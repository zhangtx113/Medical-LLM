{"question": "What causes resolution trade-offs in digital radiography compared to film-based imaging?", "think": "Digital radiography (DR) exhibits resolution trade-offs compared to film-based imaging due to larger pixel sizes in digital systems relative to the microcrystalline structure of silver halide in film. This difference, influenced by system-specific parameters and exposure settings, reduces edge clarity. However, the degradation remains below human visual detection thresholds and does not compromise diagnostic validity. The resolution trade-off arises from inherent differences in how digital sensors and film capture and resolve spatial details.", "answer": "Resolution trade-offs in digital radiography occur due to larger pixel sizes compared to film's silver halide crystals, system-specific parameters, and exposure settings, though these changes remain undetectable to the human eye and do not impair diagnostic accuracy.", "type": "Reasoning", "keyword": "pixel sizes, silver halide crystals, system-specific parameters, exposure settings, edge clarity, human visual detection, diagnostic accuracy"}
