{"question": "How do impaired vascular, contractile, and diastolic reserves contribute to exercise intolerance in HFnIEF?", "think": "Impaired vascular reserve reduces exercise-induced vasodilation, limiting blood flow. Impaired contractile reserve prevents increased cardiac output via enhanced systolic function. Impaired diastolic reserve restricts ventricular filling, reducing stroke volume. Collectively, these deficits fail to meet elevated oxygen demands during physical activity, manifesting as exercise intolerance.", "answer": "Impaired vascular, contractile, and diastolic reserves in HFnIEF limit vasodilation, cardiac output, and ventricular filling, preventing adequate oxygen delivery during exercise.", "type": "Application", "keyword": "vascular reserve, contractile reserve, diastolic reserve, oxygen delivery, exercise intolerance"}
{"question": "What compensatory role does left atrial contraction play in early HFnIEF diastolic dysfunction?", "think": "Left atrial contraction compensates for early ventricular filling reduction in HFnIEF by maintaining diastolic filling.

During this window, BMCs inhibit left ventricular end-systolic diameter expansion, enhancing systolic function recovery. The microenvironment post-reperfusion undergoes dynamic changes, including transient expression of chemokines like VEGF and SDF-1, which optimize cell homing and retention.

{"question": "Why is there a low implementation rate of advance directives despite high documentation?", "think": "The text states that 80% of Americans document advance directives, but only 20% implement them. This discrepancy arises from two factors: healthcare providers' low completion rates (only a minority complete their own directives) and delayed discussions. The sensitive nature of advance directives often causes avoidance until crises occur, and providers lack personal experience with the process, hindering effective guidance.", "answer": "Low implementation of advance directives despite high documentation results from healthcare providers' low completion rates, delayed sensitive discussions, and insufficient personal experience with the planning process.", "type": "Reasoning", "keyword": "healthcare providers, low completion rates, sensitive discussions, delayed implementation, personal experience"}
