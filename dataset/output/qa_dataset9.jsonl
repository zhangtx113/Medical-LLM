{"question": "What are the key factors determining the use of pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) in clinical practice?", "think": "The use of pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) is determined by three factors: the patient's disease status, the surgical procedure (e.g., intraoperative or postoperative fluid changes), and the operator's experience in PAC use and parameter interpretation. These factors ensure appropriate application while minimizing risks from misinterpretation.", "answer": "PAC use is determined by patient disease, surgical process (e.g., fluid changes), and operator experience in PAC interpretation.", "type": "Definition", "keyword": "patient disease, surgical process, operator experience"}
{"question": "What are the mechanisms by which β-blockers reduce perioperative cardiac risk in patients with coronary artery disease?", "think": "The text outlines ACC/AHA guidelines recommending β-blockers for patients with coronary artery disease undergoing high-risk surgeries. These agents are titrated to achieve target heart rate and blood pressure, reducing cardiac workload and ischemic risk. The guidelines emphasize their use in high-risk patients with preexisting β-blocker therapy or significant clinical risk factors, but do not explicitly detail molecular mechanisms.", "answer": "β-blockers reduce perioperative cardiac risk by titrating to target heart rate and blood pressure in high-risk coronary artery disease patients, per ACC/AHA guidelines.", "type": "Reasoning", "keyword": "β-blockers, coronary artery disease, perioperative cardiac risk, target heart rate, blood pressure, ACC/AHA guidelines"}
{"question": "What are the clinical implications of not titrating β-blocker doses to individual patient needs in non-cardiac surgery?", "think": "The guidelines state that in non-cardiac surgery, routine high-dose β-blocker use without titration to individual patient needs is ineffective and potentially harmful (evidence level B). This implies that failure to adjust doses to specific patient requirements increases risk without therapeutic benefit.", "answer": "Non-titration of β-blocker doses in non-cardiac surgery leads to ineffective therapy and potential harm due to inappropriate dosing.", "type": "Application", "keyword": "ineffective, potential harm, inappropriate dosing"}
{"question": "What are the key recommendations of the 2009 ACCF/AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade for non-cardiac surgery?", "think": "The 2009 ACCF/AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade emphasized cautious use, recommending continuation of beta blockers in patients already taking them, avoiding initiation in those without clear indications, and emphasizing titration to avoid excessive heart rate reduction. It also highlighted monitoring for hypotension and bradycardia during administration.", "answer": "The 2009 ACCF/AHA update recommended continuing beta blockers for existing users, avoiding new initiation without clear indications, careful titration to prevent excessive heart rate reduction, and monitoring for hypotension and bradycardia.", "type": "Definition", "keyword": "beta blockers, continuation, new initiation, titration, hypotension, bradycardia"}
{"question": "Why are the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) guidelines significant for pre-operative cardiac risk assessment?", "think": "The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) guidelines establish standardized protocols for pre-operative cardiac risk assessment and perioperative management in non-cardiac surgery. These guidelines are significant because they synthesize evidence-based practices to optimize patient outcomes by systematically identifying and mitigating cardiovascular risks before surgery.", "answer": "The ESC/ESA guidelines provide evidence-based protocols for pre-operative cardiac risk assessment and perioperative management in non-cardiac surgery to reduce cardiovascular risks.", "type": "Reasoning", "keyword": "European Society of Cardiology, European Society of Anaesthesiology, pre-operative cardiac risk assessment, perioperative management, non-cardiac surgery, evidence-based protocols"}
{"question": "What clinical implications arise from the AHA/ADA science advisory on dual antiplatelet therapy in coronary stent patients?", "think": "The AHA/ADA science advisory emphasizes preventing premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in coronary stent patients to avoid stent thrombosis. It was jointly developed by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, American College of Surgeons, and American Dental Association.
