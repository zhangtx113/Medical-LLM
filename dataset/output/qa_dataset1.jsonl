{"question": "Why does low disease prevalence reduce the clinical utility of a highly specific diagnostic test?", "think": "Low disease prevalence reduces the positive predictive value (PPV) of a diagnostic test, even if it is highly specific. PPV is calculated as [sensitivity × prevalence]/[sensitivity × prevalence + (1 - specificity) × (1 - prevalence)]. When prevalence is low, the denominator becomes dominated by (1 - specificity) × (1 - prevalence), which, even with high specificity, results in a low PPV. This leads to a high proportion of false positives relative to true positives. For example, in a population with 1/100,000 disease prevalence and 75% sensitivity/specificity, most positive test results are false positives. This demonstrates that clinical utility diminishes when true disease cases are rare, as the test cannot reliably distinguish between diseased and non-diseased individuals.", "answer": "Low disease prevalence reduces the clinical utility of a highly specific test because it results in a low positive predictive value, leading to a high proportion of false positives despite high specificity.", "type": "Reasoning", "keyword": "positive predictive value, low prevalence, false positives, disease prevalence"}
