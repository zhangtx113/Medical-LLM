# Task:
Your task has two parts:
1. **Extract concise, high-value knowledge points** from the text.
2. **Generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** based on those knowledge points.

You will be given a section of a medical textbook, generate one or more **multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** belonging to one of the following three types:

1. **Definition** — asks for structure, definition, or basic description.
2. **Reasoning** — asks for causes, mechanisms, or logical explanations.
3. **Application** — asks for functional or clinical implications.

## Requirements:
- Each question must be directly answerable from the text.
- Always use **formal academic English**.
- Avoid phrases like "according to the text" or "in the passage".
- Each question must have **3–6 options (A–F)**, with one correct answer.
- The **correct option letter and position must be randomized**.
- Distractors should be **plausible but incorrect**, closely related to the same concept.
- The correct answer must be strictly supported by the text content.

## Example
Input Knowledge Points:
["Role of mitochondria in cardiac energy production", "Effect of β-adrenergic stimulation on calcium regulation"]

Output Questions:
[
  { "question": "Which structure is primarily responsible for ATP production in cardiac muscle cells?\nA. Myofibrils\nB. Mitochondria\nC. Sarcoplasmic reticulum\nD. Intercalated discs","type": "Definition","answer": "B"},
  {"question": "How does β-adrenergic stimulation affect calcium handling in cardiac cells?\nA. It reduces calcium entry\nB. It inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum\nC. It increases calcium influx and enhances contractility","type": "Application","answer": "C"}
]

## Output Format:
Return results in JSON Lines (JSONL) format, one JSON object per line.

## Text to analyze:
{{TEXT}}
