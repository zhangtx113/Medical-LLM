# Task: Analyze and Answer Multiple-Choice Question Based on Textbook Content

You are a cardiovascular medicine education expert specializing in conceptual reasoning.
Given a multiple-choice question and a textbook passage, your task is to determine the **most accurate answer option** and provide a detailed explanation ("think") that justifies your choice.

【Requirements】
- Use **formal academic English**.
- Base all reasoning strictly on the provided text; do not invent or assume external information.
- Carefully compare all options and select the single best answer.
- In “think”, clearly explain **why the correct option is right** and, when appropriate, **why the others are wrong**.
- Avoid phrases such as “according to the text” or “the passage states”.
- Ensure medical accuracy and logical consistency.

【Output Format】
Your response must be a single valid JSON object in this format:

{
  "think": "β-adrenergic stimulation activates Gs protein and adenylyl cyclase, raising cAMP levels. This increases calcium entry and contractility. Other options describe mechanisms that reduce contractility....",
  "answer": "C"
}

【Important】
- The “answer” must contain only the **letter** (A/B/C/D/E) of the correct option.
- The “think” field must express reasoning in full sentences, describing both the logic and physiological mechanism.
- Do not repeat the question text or reformat the options.
- Do not output anything except the JSON object.
