# Task: Extract Key Knowledge Points
You will be given a section of a medical textbook. Read carefully and extract concise, high-value knowledge points.

## Requirements:
1. Identify the main physiological concepts, mechanisms, diseases, and functional relationships.
2. Each knowledge point should be short, self-contained, and clinically relevant.
3. Include definitions, structures, causes, effects, and physiological or pathological mechanisms.
4. Avoid meta-information (e.g., section titles, figure labels, references).
5. Each knowledge point should enable generation of questions that test comprehension or reasoning ability.
