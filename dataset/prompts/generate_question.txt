# Task: Generate Structured Questions Based on Knowledge Points
You are given a list of key knowledge points and a corresponding textbook passage.
For each knowledge point, generate one or more questions belonging to one of the following three types:

1. **Definition** — asks for structure, definition, or basic description.
2. **Reasoning** — asks for causes, mechanisms, or logical explanations.
3. **Application** — asks for functional or clinical implications.

## Requirements:
- Each question must be directly answerable from the text.
- Avoid phrases like "according to the text" or "in the passage".
- Questions should cover different levels of reasoning and stay within medical context.
- Each output must contain: {"question": "...", "type": "Definition" or "Reasoning" or "Application"}

## Example
Input Knowledge Points:
["Role of mitochondria in cardiac energy production", "Effect of β-adrenergic stimulation on calcium regulation"]

Output Questions:
[
  {"question": "What is the role of mitochondria in energy production in cardiac cells?", "type": "Definition"},
  {"question": "How does β-adrenergic stimulation influence calcium handling in cardiac muscle cells?", "type": "Application"}
]

## Output Format:
Return results in JSON Lines (JSONL) format, one JSON object per line.

## Knowledge Points:
{{KNOWLEDGE}}

## Text to analyze:
{{TEXT}}
