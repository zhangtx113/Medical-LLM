## ANSWER TO QUESTION 1  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 15: p. 181)  

The normal systolic blood pressure response during exercise is a progressive increase to a peak value between 160 and \(200\mathrm{mmHg}\) . The higher end of this range is more commonly observed in older patients; in general, Black patients tend to have a higher systolic blood pressure response to exercise than White patients. A failure to increase systolic blood pressure to at least \(120\mathrm{mmHg}\) or a decline in systolic blood pressure during exercise, is abnormal. Such exertional hypotension occurs in \(3\%\) to \(9\%\) of patients and is suggestive of underlying multivesel or left main coronary artery disease (CAD). Other causes of a decline in systolic blood pressure, or a failure to increase systolic blood pressure with exercise, include cardiomyopathy, vasovagal reactions, ventricular outflow obstruction, hypovolemia, arrhythmias, and prolonged vigorous exercise. Subjects who demonstrate hypotension in the postexercise period are much less likely to have advanced underlying CAD; approximately \(3\%\) of normal subjects younger than 55 years of age demonstrate such a response.  

In normal subjects, diastolic blood pressure does not change significantly during exercise. A large change in diastolic blood pressure is uncommon and has not been shown to correlate with underlying CAD.  

The age- related maximum predicted heart rate (MPHR) is estimated from the following formula:  

\[\mathrm{MPHR} = 220 - \mathrm{age}(\mathrm{in}\mathrm{years})\]  

which in this patient would be 166 beats/minute. The peak heart rate he achieved during the test was 152 beats/minute, or \(92\%\) of the MPHR (i.e., 152/166 beats/minute). An achieved heart rate of \(85\%\) or more MPHR is indicative of an adequate diagnostic workload.  

Predictors of low prognostic coronary risk in his case include his very good functional capacity (having achieved stage IV of the Bruce protocol) and lack of cardiopulmonary symptoms or ST- segment changes during the test.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 2  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 13: p. 131)  

The normal second heart sound \(\mathrm{(S_2)}\) consists of two parts: an earlier aortic component and a later pulmonic component. During inspiration, the increased filling of the right ventricle prolongs the ejection phase of the right side of the heart, leading to delayed closure of the pulmonic valve. This is the predominant factor in normal inspiratory splitting of the \(\mathrm{S_2}\) . Right bundle branch block delays right ventricular (RV) activation and ejection and is therefore associated with widened splitting of \(\mathrm{S_2}\) . Conditions in which left ventricular activation is late, such as left bundle branch block or RV pacing, cause closure of the aortic valve to be delayed. In that setting, the pulmonic valve closure sound actually precedes that of the aortic valve. Then, during inspiration (and prolongation of RV ejection), the delayed closure of the pulmonic valve narrows the timing between the two sounds, a situation known as paradoxical splitting.  

Fixed splitting of the \(\mathrm{S_2}\) is typical of an uncomplicated ostium secundum atrial septal defect. In this condition, closure of the pulmonic valve is delayed because of the increased flow through the right- sided cardiac chambers and an increase in pulmonary vascular capacitance, contributing to a widened split of \(\mathrm{S_2}\) . On inspiration, augmentation of the systemic venous return is counterbalanced by a reciprocal decrease in the volume of the left- to- right shunt, such that RV filling and the timing of \(\mathrm{P_2}\) relative to \(\mathrm{A_2}\) do not change, resulting in the fixed splitting.  

When valvular stenosis restricts opening of a cardiac valve, the decreased excursion of the leaflets reduces the intensity of the closure sound. Thus, in pulmonic stenosis, the pulmonic component of \(\mathrm{S_2}\) becomes softer.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 5: pp. 53-54; Fig. 5.6)  

In addition to accuracy and reliability, the performance of a diagnostic test depends on its ability to distinguish between the presence and absence of disease. Test performance depends on its sensitivity and specificity, as

<--- Page Split --->

well as the prevalence of disease in the population of patients to be studied or the pretest probability of disease in a particular patient. Sensitivity and specificity are characteristics of the diagnostic test that are not altered by disease prevalence or pretest probability. Sensitivity is the percentage of patients with disease who will be correctly identified by the test. Specificity is the percentage of patients without disease who will be correctly identified as disease free by the test. Positive predictive value is the probability that a positive test correctly identifies the presence of disease. Negative predictive value is the probability that a negative test correctly identifies the absence of disease. A perfect diagnostic test has a positive predictive value of \(100\%\) (no false- negative results) and a negative predictive value of \(100\%\) (no false- positive results).  

For a diagnostic test with moderately high sensitivity and specificity, the test will perform best in a population of patients with an intermediate pretest probability of disease (patient D). In patients with a low pretest probability of disease (patients A and B), the positive predictive value of the test is low, and there will be a large number of false- positive tests that may prompt unnecessary testing and procedures. In patients with an extremely high pretest probability of disease (patients C and E), the negative predictive value of the test is low and the possibility that a negative result represents a false negative is unacceptably high.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 4  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 131, 134; Table 13.6; Fig. 13.7)  

The term continuous applies to murmurs that begin in systole and continue without interruption into part or all of diastole. The murmur described here, that of a patent ductus arteriosus, is the classic continuous murmur, peaking in intensity just before or after \(\mathrm{S}_2\) , then decreasing in intensity during diastole, sometimes disappearing before the subsequent first heart sound. Continuous murmurs may be congenital or acquired and can be caused by (1) an aortopulmonary shunt, such as patent ductus arteriosus; (2) an arteriovenous shunt, including arteriovenous fistulas, coronary artery fistulas, or rupture of an aortic sinus of Valsalva aneurysm into a right heart chamber; (3) constricted arterial vessels (e.g., a femoral arterial atherosclerotic stenosis); (4) turbulence in nonconstricted arteries (e.g., the "mammary souffle," an innocent flow murmur heard during late pregnancy and the puerperium over the lactating breast and augmented by light pressure with the stethoscope); or (5) venous murmurs, such as a cervical venous hum, an often "rough"- sounding murmur present in healthy children and young adults. The cervical hum may be accentuated by deforming the internal jugular vein with rotation of the head. It is augmented during pregnancy and in disease states in which there is increased venous flow, such as thyrotoxicosis.  

The combined murmurs of aortic stenosis and regurgitation have distinct systolic and diastolic components and do not constitute a continuous murmur.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 5  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 129-130; Fig. 13.4)  

Reduced or unequal arterial pulsations may occur in the arms of patients with atherosclerosis affecting the subclavian arteries, aortic dissection, and uncommon arteritides such as Takayasu disease. In supravalvular aortic stenosis (AS) there may be selective streaming of the arterial jet toward the innominate artery and right arm, leading to higher pressures in that extremity. This is not the case, however, with either subvalvular or valvular AS. Coarctation of the aorta in adults usually involves the aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery and leads to higher blood pressure in the upper extremities compared with the legs; the arm pulses and pressures are typically equal.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 6  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 16: p. 200; Figs. 16.58 and 16.60)  

This patient with metastatic breast cancer and a large pericardial effusion has clinical findings consistent with cardiac tamponade. Tamponade physiology results when an accumulation of pericardial effusion causes equilibration of intrapericardial and intracardiac pressures. In addition to the presence of an echo- free space surrounding the heart, characteristic echocardiographic and Doppler findings reflect the aberrant physiology. Collapse of the right ventricle during early diastole occurs because the abnormally elevated pericardial pressure transiently exceeds right ventricular (RV) pressure at that phase of the cardiac cycle. Indentation of the right atrial wall during diastole is a more sensitive marker of increased pericardial pressure but is less specific for tamponade physiology than RV collapse and tends to occur earlier in the course of hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion. Cardiac tamponade is associated with exaggerated ventricular interdependence, a phenomenon manifested at the

bedside by pulsus paradoxus. The Doppler correlate of pulsus paradoxus is amplified respirophasic variation of flow across the right- and left- sided cardiac valves. This includes a prominent inspiratory decrease in flow velocity across the mitral and aortic valves (see the transmittal tracing in Fig. 1.64), whereas inspiration causes a prominent reciprocal increase in flow velocity across the tricuspid and pulmonic valves.  

A marked increase of the E/A ratio of the mitral valve inflow velocity is a finding typical of constrictive pericarditis, not cardiac tamponade.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 7  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 13: p.129)  

Pulsus paradoxus is an exaggeration of the normal tendency for arterial pulse strength to fall with inspiration and can be measured easily and accurately at the bedside with a sphygmomanometer. A decline of more than 8 to \(10\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) with inspiration is considered abnormal and can be observed in a variety of conditions. Pulsus paradoxus is characteristic of patients with cardiac tamponade, is seen in approximately one- third of patients with chronic constrictive pericarditis, and is noted as well in patients with wide intrapleural pressure swings (e.g., bronchial asthma and emphysema), pulmonary embolism, pregnancy, extreme obesity, and hypovolemic shock.  

Notably, aortic regurgitation augments left ventricular diastolic pressure and tends to prevent pulsus paradoxus even in the presence of tamponade.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 8  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 14: p.160; Table 14.1; Fig. 14.33)  

The clinical presentation is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome, and rapid evaluation of the ECG is critical to detect whether an acute ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is present, which would warrant prompt coronary revascularization. The ECG in this patient is not diagnostic for STEMI, with less than \(1\mathrm{mm}\) of ST elevation in only one lead (III). However, the presence of ST depressions and a prominent R wave in the anterior precordial leads should raise suspicion for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction in the posterior territory. Because standard leads are not placed on the patient's back, myocardial injury of the posterior wall is typically identified as mirror- image ECG findings in the opposite anatomic position, namely leads \(\mathrm{V}_1\) to \(\mathrm{V}_3\) . In this circumstance, posteriorly placed ECG leads \((\mathrm{V}_7 - \mathrm{V}_9)\) placed from the posterior axillary line to the left border of the spine would be helpful to evaluate for true posterior ST elevations.  

Right- sided precordial leads are useful to detect right ventricular involvement in the setting of an inferior STEMI. Awaiting the results of cardiac biomarkers would delay care. Diagnostic tests should focus first on an acute coronary syndrome rather than pulmonary embolism, based on the presenting clinical symptoms.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 9  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 9: Tables 9.1-9.3)  

All drugs prescribed to achieve a particular clinical benefit also have the potential for toxicity. Many factors determine the likelihood of drug toxicity, including the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug and its target, genetic variability in the patient's response to the drug, and drug- drug interactions.  

Many medications are metabolized by isoforms of the cytochrome P- 450 (CYP) enzyme system, which are expressed in the liver and other tissues. Ketoconazole, erythromycin, and clarithromycin (but not azithromycin) are examples of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Because these P- 450 isoforms are responsible for metabolism of simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin, combined therapy with such inhibitors may increase the likelihood of myopathy due to these statins.1,2 Pravastatin is not metabolized by the CYP3A system, and thus the risk of myopathy is not increased in the presence of CYP3A inhibitors.  

St. John's wort induces activity of CYP3A and results in decreased cyclosporine levels.3  

Sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction, potentiates the vasodilatory effect of nitrates. Administration of nitrates within 24 hours of sildenafil use has been associated with profound hypotension.  

Verapamil inhibits the P- glycoprotein- mediated efflux of digoxin into bile and urine and may contribute to digoxin toxicity.

D (Braunwald, Ch 15: p. 177; Table 15.1)Treadmill exercise testing is a safe procedure with an associated mortality of less than \(0.01\%\) and risk of myocardial infarction of \(0.04\%\) . The risk of a procedure- related complication is determined by the clinical characteristics of the patient to be studied. Patients with high- grade obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, such as those with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or critical aortic stenosis, are at an increased risk of a procedural complication owing to the inability of cardiac output to compensate for peripheral vasodilatation during

exercise. Patients with unstable angina should not be subjected to the high myocardial oxygen demands of exercise and should be referred for coronary angiography instead. Acute myocarditis is associated with an increased risk of exercise- associated sudden death.  

Despite the theoretical risk of aortic rupture due to increased wall stress, treadmill exercise testing may be safely performed in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. In contrast, aortic dissection is a contraindication to the stress of exercise testing.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 18: pp. 287-288; Fig. 18.10)  

The images show a fixed defect in the mid- and apical anterior wall segments, with preserved wall motion and thickening, as evident from the end-diastolic and end-systolic frames. These findings are most consistent with imaging artifact due to breast tissue attenuation.  

Attenuation artifacts are a common source of error in single- photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Regional wall motion and wall thickening should be assessed on the electrocardiographic- gated SPECT data in any region that shows a fixed perfusion defect. Although a transmural myocardial scar would be associated with reduced wall motion and wall thickening, attenuation artifact is more likely where there is a fixed perfusion defect with normal regional wall motion and wall thickening.  

Thallium- 201 is a lower- energy radiotracer that results in more attenuation artifacts than technetium- 99m imaging, and hence would be an inferior choice in this case.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 23: p. 412; Figs. 23.1 and 23.2; Tables 23.1 and 23.3)  

This patient with acute cholecystitis is being evaluated for intraperitoneal (intermediate risk) surgery, which carries a cardiac risk of cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction of \(1\%\) to \(5\%\) . He has no clinical evidence of a recent acute coronary syndrome and can achieve at least 4 metabolic equivalents (METs), climbing a flight of stairs regularly, without cardiopulmonary symptoms. For such a  

patient, current guidelines recommend that no additional cardiac testing is required prior to surgery. For patients with poor or unknown functional capacity, pharmacologic stress testing is recommended if the results will impact decision- making. For patients with ischemic heart disease undergoing intermediate- or high- risk surgery who can achieve greater than 4 METs, guidelines conclude that initiation of a titrated low- dose beta- blocker regimen may be considered prior to surgery, commencing at least 1 day prior to the procedure. This patient is already taking metoprolol succinate, which should be continued in the perioperative period.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 13  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 15: p. 182)  

Electrocardiographic changes during exertion in an asymptomatic patient must be interpreted in light of the pretest likelihood of coronary disease. An exercise- induced ST- segment abnormality is an independent predictor of future cardiac events in men with and without conventional risk factors for coronary disease, although the risk is greatest among the former. However, in over 5 years of follow- up, only one in four such patients will actually develop symptoms of cardiac disease, most commonly angina. Because the patient described in this question is asymptomatic and demonstrates good exercise capacity, there is no need for immediate aggressive intervention such as cardiac catheterization. Appropriate recommendations for this patient with asymptomatic coronary artery disease would include aggressive risk factor modification: smoking cessation, control of hypertension, the addition of aspirin, and statin therapy.  

The distribution of ST- segment depressions during exercise testing correlates poorly with the location of coronary stenoses. Conversely, the location of ST- segment elevations, when present, does correlate well with the anatomic lesion causing ischemia.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 14  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 15: pp. 182, 184; Table 15.10)  

Several clinical situations affect the ST segment and impair the diagnostic utility of the standard exercise ECG. These include the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB), left ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular preexcitation (Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome), and digitalis therapy. In these situations, other aspects of the exercise test, such as exercise duration, presence or absence of symptoms, and abnormal blood pressure or heart rate responses, may still provide useful diagnostic information. However, in the presence of these baseline electrocardiographic abnormalities, concurrent imaging (e.g., nuclear scintigraphy or echocardiography) is frequently required when more specific diagnostic information is needed. In the case of LBBB, a vasodilator pharmacologic (e.g., adenosine or regadenoson) stress test with myocardial perfusion imaging helps to avoid artifactual septal perfusion defects compared with exercise protocols.  

In patients with a low prior probability of significant coronary artery disease (CAD), such as a young woman without significant cardiac risk factors, the development of ST- segment depression on exercise testing is more often a nonspecific false- positive result than an indicator of previously undetected CAD.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 15  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 21: pp. 364-366; Fig. 21.2; Table 21.1)  

Diagnostic cardiac catheterization is a relatively safe procedure, with an overall risk of a major complication of \(1\%\) . Mortality rates related to the procedure depend on the population studied and range from \(0.08\%\) to \(0.75\%\) . The risk of myocardial infarction is approximately \(0.05\%\) , and neurologic complications occur in \(0.03\%\) to \(0.2\%\) of patients. The incidence of acute renal dysfunction in patients with baseline renal insufficiency can be most effectively decreased with intravenous saline administration before and after the procedure. The addition of mannitol or furosemide to saline infusion has been shown to worsen renal outcomes in patients receiving an intravenous contrast agent.  

Nonionic low osmolar contrast agents reduce the likelihood of adverse hemodynamic and electrophysiologic reactions during angiography. They also reduce the incidence of contrast- induced nephropathy in patients with baseline renal insufficiency, with or without diabetes. Of note, in patients with normal renal function, there is no advantage of low osmolar agents over ionic agents in the prevention of nephrotoxicity.  

Cardiac catheters are available in many sizes, shapes, and lengths. The outer diameter of the catheter is specified using French units (F), where 1 F is equal to \(0.33\mathrm{mm}\) .  

Patients with tilting- disc prosthetic aortic valves should not undergo retrograde left- sided heart catheterization because of the risk of catheter entrapment, occlusion of the valve, or possible dislodgement of the disc with embolization.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 16  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 14: p. 160; Fig. 14.37)  

C (Braunwald, Ch 14: p. 160; Fig. 14.37)Proximal occlusion of a dominant right coronary artery (RCA) leads to infarction of the left ventricular (LV) inferior wall, but often also involves the posterior wall, the right ventricle, and portions of the conduction system, which are all supplied by branches of the RCA. ST- segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF is the sine qua non of transmural infarction of the inferior wall. If the posterior wall is involved, ST- segment depression is usually evident in \(\mathrm{V_1}\) and \(\mathrm{V_2}\) , reflecting a current of injury on the side of the heart opposite those leads (if unipolar leads were placed on the patient's back overlying the posterior wall, ST- segment elevation would be observed instead). Very proximal occlusion of the RCA is often accompanied by right ventricular (RV) infarction because the RV arterial branch arises near the origin of that vessel. If RV infarction is present, right- sided precordial leads, particularly \(\mathrm{V_1R}\) , typically demonstrate ST- segment elevation as well (Fig. 1.65). Sinus bradycardia may occur, especially in inferior or posterior infarction. This arrhythmia, particularly when accompanied by hypotension, may arise from stimulation of cardiac vagal afferent fibers, which are prominent in the inferoposterior left ventricle. Sinus bradycardia may also be a vasovagal response to the severe chest pain in acute myocardial infarction or reflect ischemia of the sinoatrial artery, which arises from the RCA in \(60\%\) of the population. Another potential cause of bradycardia in this patient is the development of atrioventricular (AV) block because of either vagal stimulation or ischemia of the AV node. The AV node is supplied by the AV nodal artery, which arises from the RCA \(85\%\) of the time.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 17  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 199-200, 259; Fig. 16.4)  

One of the most clinically important applications of Doppler technology is the estimation of pressure gradients across stenotic orifices or septal defects in the cardiovascular system. The Bernoulli equation relates the pressure difference across a narrowed area to the convective acceleration, flow acceleration, and viscous friction. By modifying the Bernoulli equation, a more clinically useful simplified formula

<--- Page Split --->
![](images/62_0.jpg)

<center>FIG.1.65 </center>  

is derived. The simplified Bernoulli equation states that the pressure difference across a flow- limiting orifice \(= 4V^2\) where V is the peak velocity distal to the obstruction. In this question, the patient's systolic blood pressure is \(144~\mathrm{mm~Hg}\) which, in the absence of left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction, is also the LV systolic pressure. If the ventricular septal defect (VSD) flow is \(5.1~\mathrm{m / second}\) , then using the modified Bernoulli equation, the pressure gradient across the VSD is \(4\times (5.1)^2 = 104~\mathrm{mm~Hg}\) . The right ventricular systolic pressure can then be calculated by subtracting that gradient from the LV systolic pressure: \(144\) to \(104\) or \(40~\mathrm{mm~Hg}\) . The transmittal flow velocity is not needed for this calculation.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 18  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 13: p. 135; Ch 16: p. 216; Fig. 16.26)  

This patient's history is concerning for an undetected acute myocardial infarction (MI) 10 days earlier, including the prolonged chest symptom, new Q waves in the inferior leads, and inferior wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography. The lack of acute intervention places the patient at risk for post- MI mechanical complications, including acute mitral regurgitation (MR) due to dysfunction or rupture of a papillary muscle, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and free wall rupture. The brief systolic murmur on examination in the setting of new- onset heart failure should raise suspicion for acute MR. Although chronic MR typically produces a holosystolic murmur at the apex, in acute MR there may only be a soft, early systolic murmur due to the rapid systolic increase in pressure in the unprepared and noncompliant left atrium (LA) that attenuates the pressure gradient between the left ventricle and LA responsible for the murmur.  

The presumed recent right coronary artery occlusion in this patient would impair the blood supply to the posteromedial papillary muscle. Dysfunction or rupture of this papillary muscle often produces MR in an eccentric direction, which may be underestimated by transthoracic echocardiography, especially in this patient with poor acoustic windows. Given the high suspicion for papillary muscle involvement resulting in acute MR, a transesophageal echocardiogram would be appropriate, with cardiac surgical consultation for consideration of urgent valve repair. In most cases, coronary revascularization would be addressed with bypass grafting at the time of valve surgery rather than with percutaneous intervention.   

A nuclear stress test would not address the urgent mechanical process in this patient's situation. The location of the murmur and echocardiographic findings are not consistent with a VSD, such that urgent right heart catheterization alone would not be the best immediate approach.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 19  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 14: p. 170; Fig. 14.46)  

Many electrolyte disturbances result in characteristic electrocardiographic manifestations. Decreased extracellular calcium in hypocalcemia prolongs phase 2 of the action potential (AP), thereby lengthening the AP duration and the QT interval. The long QT interval in hypocalcemia is characteristically flat (i.e., isoelectric), without the concave configuration of many drug- induced prolonged QT states. Increased extracellular calcium shortens the ventricular AP and the duration of the QT interval. The appearance of a J wave (also known as an Osborn wave—see arrow in Fig. 1.66), an extra deflection at the junction of the QRS complex and the ST segment that is typically observed in severe hypothermia, has been reported with severe hypercalcemia.  

Hyperkalemia causes a specific sequence of electrocardiographic changes depending on its severity. The earliest manifestation is narrow, peaked T waves. The QT interval is usually decreased at that time because of shortened AP duration. Progressive hyperkalemia reduces the resting

<center>FIG. 1.66 </center>  

membrane potentials in both the atria and ventricles, thus inactivating sodium channels. The net result is to slow depolarization and reduce AP conduction velocity. The ECG shows widening of the QRS complex with a decrease in P wave amplitude. PR- segment prolongation may also occur. Very marked hyperkalemia leads to slow, undulating ventricular flutter (a "sine wave" appearance) followed by eventual asystole. Hypokalemia, in contrast, manifests primarily as ST- segment depressions with flattened T waves and U wave prominence. Because of prolongation of the QT interval, there is a propensity for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes).

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 20  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 221, 252- 253; Fig. 16.34; Ch 52: p. 1044; Figs. 52.11- 52.14)  

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. The lungs are affected in greater than \(90\%\) of patients. Autopsy studies demonstrate cardiac involvement in at least \(25\%\) of patients who have pulmonary sarcoid. The three principal manifestations of cardiac sarcoidosis are conduction abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias, and/or ventricular dysfunction. Several imaging modalities are useful in the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis. Although echocardiography may show no abnormalities in clinically silent disease, systolic and/ or diastolic ventricular dysfunction can be visualized in patients with active sarcoidosis. Discrete regional wall motion abnormalities typically appear in noncoronary distributions.  

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is sensitive for identifying abnormalities in sarcoidosis. LGE is usually patchy and nontransmural, with sparing of the endocardial border. LGE most commonly occurs in the basal septum and lateral wall and/or midmyocardium. CMR is helpful in the assessment of clinically silent disease, as it can identify small regions of LGE, even in patients with normal systolic function. Of note, CMR cannot distinguish regions of active inflammation from permanent scar.  

\(^{18}\mathrm{F}\) - fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), which reveals regions of inflammation in active disease, is complementary to CMR in the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and in the monitoring of response to therapy. Focal FDG PET uptake identifies areas of active inflammation typical of active cardiac sarcoidosis; in distinction, areas of scarring without active inflammation do not show uptake by this technique.  

Although angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are elevated in \(60\%\) of patients with sarcoidosis, the test has both low sensitivity and specificity for identifying the condition.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 21  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 14: p. 156; Table 14.8)  

The underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The Ashman phenomenon (as exemplified by the fifth QRS complex in the tracing) represents conduction aberrancy caused by changes in the preceding cycle length. Because the duration of the refractory period is a function of the immediate preceding cycle length, the longer the preceding cycle, the longer the ensuing refractory period and the more likely that the next impulse will be conducted with delay. Normally the length of the refractory periods of the conduction system components are as follows: right bundle branch \(>\) left bundle branch \(=\) atrioventricular node \(>>\) His bundle. Therefore, it would be unusual for the bundle of His to be the site of conduction delay, and, as is commonly the case, the aberrant beat on this tracing demonstrates right bundle branch block morphology in lead \(\mathrm{V}_1\)

Innocent (normal) systolic murmurs are related to intracranial flow rates and are usually loudest in midlystole. They may be caused by normal vibrations of the pulmonary leaflets, by exaggeration of normal ejection vibrations within the pulmonary artery, or it may be associated with sclerosis at the base of the aortic valve leaflets in the absence of significant valvular stenosis. The mammary souffle, heard over the breasts of healthy women in late pregnancy or during lactation, may also be midystolic in timing or continuous. Careful auscultation usually reveals a time delay between \(\mathrm{S}_1\) and onset of this murmur.

A great deal of information about right- sided heart hemodynamics can be ascertained from the jugular venous pressure waveforms. The \(a\) wave results from venous

<--- Page Split --->

distention due to right atrial contraction; the \(x\) descent reflects atrial relaxation and downward descent of the base of the right atrium (RA) during right ventricular (RV) systole. The \(c\) wave is an inconstant positive deflection in the jugular venous pulse that interrupts the \(x\) descent and corresponds to ventricular contraction. The \(v\) wave results from right atrial filling during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed, and the \(y\) descent occurs after the tricuspid valve opens and right atrial pressure declines. It is easier for an observer to see the \(x\) and \(y\) descents than the positive pressure waves ( \(a\) , \(c\) , and \(v\) waves) in the neck because the former produce larger excursions. An elevated jugular venous pressure reflects increased right atrial pressure. During inspiration, the jugular venous pressure normally declines as intrathoracic pressure becomes more negative. The Kussmaul sign is a paradoxical rise in the height of the venous pressure during inspiration. It reflects an inability of the right- sided chambers to accept additional volume, typical of constrictive pericarditis, but may also be observed in patients with right- sided heart failure, severe cor pulmonale, or tricuspid stenosis.  

The \(a\) wave becomes more prominent in conditions that increase the resistance to right atrial contraction, such as RV hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, or tricuspid stenosis. Amplified "cannon" \(a\) waves are evident during any situation that causes atrioventricular dissociation, because the RA intermittently contracts against a closed tricuspid valve.  

In constrictive pericarditis, the \(y\) descent is rapid and deep because the very earliest phase of diastolic RV filling is unimpeded. In contrast, in cardiac tamponade, the \(y\) descent is blunted, and it is the \(x\) descent that is more prominent.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 24  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 22: p. 393; Table 22.1; Fig. 22.13)  

There is no completely accurate method for measuring cardiac output in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Two commonly used methods are the thermodilution and the Fick techniques. The former involves injection of a bolus of fluid (i.e., saline or dextrose) into the proximal port of a right- sided balloon flotation (e.g., Swan- Ganz) catheter, after which alterations in temperature are measured at the distal end of the catheter. The change in the temperature over time is then plotted to derive the cardiac output, which is inversely related to the area under the thermodilution curve (Fig. 1.67). In low cardiac output states, there is a larger area under the curve owing to the longer time required for the temperature curve to return to its baseline. However, this technique tends to overestimate cardiac output in the setting of low output states, because the dissipation of the cooler temperature to the surrounding cardiac structures results in a reduction in the total area under the curve. In patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, the back- and- forth flow across the tricuspid valve also creates significant error in measurement, producing a falsely low cardiac output by this technique.  

The Fick technique is based on the principle that cardiac output is equal to the oxygen consumption divided by the difference in oxygen content between arterial and mixed venous blood. That is,  

![](images/64_0.jpg)

<center>FIG. 1.67 </center>  

\[\mathrm{Cardiac~output} = \frac{\mathrm{O}_2\mathrm{consumption}}{\mathrm{A} - \mathrm{VO}_2\mathrm{difference}}\]  

The Fick technique is more accurate than thermodilution in patients with low cardiac outputs; however, its main limitation is in measuring true oxygen consumption in a steady state. Many laboratories use an "assumed" oxygen consumption by considering the patient's age, gender, and body surface area. Inaccuracy in the oxygen consumption measurement can result in substantial variability in reported cardiac outputs.  

Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is derived by dividing the difference between the mean aortic and right atrial (RA) pressures by the systemic cardiac output (and then multiplying by a constant to convert to the commonly used units of dynes- sec- cm- 5):  

\[\mathrm{SVR} = 80\times \frac{\mathrm{Mean~aortic~pressure} - \mathrm{Mean~RA~pressure}}{\mathrm{Systemic~cardiac~output}}\]  

The pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is obtained by dividing the difference between the mean pulmonary artery (PA) and left atrial (LA) pressures by the pulmonic cardiac output (then multiplying by the same constant). The pulmonary capillary wedge (PCW) pressure is commonly used as a surrogate for LA pressure:  

\[\mathrm{PVR} = 80\times \frac{\mathrm{Mean~PA~pressure} - \mathrm{Mean~LA~or~PCW~pressure}}{\mathrm{Pulmonic~cardiac~output}}\]  

In the absence of intracardiac shunts, the systemic and pulmonic cardiac outputs should be the same.

Pulsed Doppler interrogation of mitral valve inflow is useful in identifying disorders of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. In normal adults, the early (E wave) velocity exceeds the late (A wave) velocity such that the normal E/A ratio is greater than 1.2. The figure accompanying this question illustrates an abnormal pattern of mitral inflow, with an E/A ratio less than 1.0. Although this pattern may

<--- Page Split --->

be present in patients who have documented abnormalities of LV relaxation, it can also occur as a result of normal aging. In fact, most people older than age 70 years have an E/A ratio of less than 1.0. In addition, the pattern of diastolic mitral inflow is load- dependent. If a patient with the illustrated pattern of impaired relaxation were administered intravenous volume, the mitral inflow pattern could change to the "pseudonormalized" form, with an E/A ratio greater than 1.0, without any alteration in the intrinsic relaxation properties of the ventricle. Caution should thus be used when inferring a diastolic or relaxation abnormality from the mitral inflow pattern. Although none of the available echocardiographic indices of diastolic function are infallible, and even stepwise approaches using the mitral inflow pattern, Doppler tissue imaging, and assessment of pulmonary venous inflow can result in internally inconsistent results, echocardiographic measures of diastolic function nonetheless provide clinically important diagnostic and prognostic information.  

Constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy are clinical situations in which the bulk of ventricular filling occurs in early diastole. In these conditions there is a high E/A ratio, often greater than 2.0. Hyperthyroidism and hemorrhage each result in hyperdynamic states in which diastolic relaxation is enhanced, such that reversal of the E/A ratio would be unusual.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 26  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 226-227; Figs. 16.31 and 16.32; eFig. 16.25; Fig. 16.34)  

The figure accompanying this question displays continuous Doppler interrogation of transmitral valvular flow obtained from the apical four- chamber transducer position. During diastole, the deceleration of transmitral inflow is prolonged, consistent with a persistent pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle, as occurs in mitral stenosis (MS). In systole, a faint signal of mitral regurgitation (MR) is seen as a downward velocity spectrum. To determine the extent of MR noninvasively, simultaneous two- dimensional echocardiography and color Doppler interrogation would be required. However, the presented Doppler spectrum of mitral inflow is sufficient to determine the severity of MS, including the transmitral pressure gradient and the valve area, as described below.  

The mitral valve area can be calculated noninvasively by three distinct noninvasive echo- Doppler methods. First, if an adequate two- dimensional short- axis image can be obtained in diastole, the valve orifice can be traced and the valve area measured directly using planimetry. The second method (which can be applied to the provided figure) utilizes the Doppler pressure half- time (PHT), which calculates the time in milliseconds required for the diastolic transmitral pressure gradient to decline to one- half of its peak value. Because of the relationship between velocity and pressure, this requires determining the time it takes for the peak diastolic velocity to fall to the peak velocity divided by the square root of 2. Most modern echocardiographic machines calculate the PHT automatically once the Doppler profile is traced on the screen, using the following equation:   

\[\mathrm{Mitral~value~area} = 220\div \mathrm{PHT}\]  

This relationship becomes less accurate when there is marked MR or aortic regurgitation, which interferes with the measured pressure gradient across the mitral valve. The third method to calculate the mitral valve area utilizes the continuity equation, which is based on the principle that the volume rate of flow through the heart is constant.  

The cause of MS in the vast majority of adults is rheumatic heart disease. Occasionally, other etiologies can be identified, such as congenital abnormalities of the valve or heavy calcification that restricts transvalvular flow. The transvalvular Doppler pattern cannot distinguish the etiology of MS, but two- dimensional echocardiographic imaging is usually diagnostic in this regard.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 27  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 199-200, 209, 248, 247-248; eFigs.16.4 and 16.33; Fig.16.72; Table 16.7)  

The McConnell sign is a distinct regional wall motion abnormality associated with acute pulmonary embolism in which the right ventricular (RV) midwall is dyskinetic, with sparing of the apex. The Kussmaul sign refers to a rise in jugular venous pressure (or its failure to decrease) with inspiration, which occurs in states of reduced RV compliance and right- sided volume overload. It is typically associated with constrictive pericarditis, but is also seen in pulmonary embolism, RV infarction, and restrictive cardiomyopathy.  

The general calculation of a pressure gradient across a cardiac valve is determined by the simplified Bernoulli equation:  

\[\Delta \mathrm{Pressure} = 4\times \mathrm{velocity}^2\]  

In this patient, the pressure gradient between the RV and right atrium (RA) is \(36\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}(4\times 3^{2})\) . The RV pressure can then be calculated as this pressure gradient plus the RA pressure. The right atrial pressure can be estimated from the echocardiographic diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and its respiratory variation (see Braunwald, Ch16: Table 16.7). In this case, the IVC diameter is normal (<2.1 cm), but there is less than \(50\%\) inspiratory collapse, consistent with a right atrial pressure of \(5\) to \(10\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) . With a right atrial pressure of \(5\) to \(10\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) and a pressure gradient of \(36\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) between the RA and RV, the RV systolic pressure can then be estimated at \(41\) to \(46\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) . In the absence of pulmonic stenosis, the pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure is equal to the RV systolic pressure, such that the estimated PA systolic pressure in this patient is also \(41\) to \(46\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) .

## C (Braunwald, Ch 15: pp. 175, 181-182; Fig. 15.2)  

C (Braunwald, Ch 15: pp. 175, 181- 182; Fig. 15.2)With normal aerobic exercise, the heart rate and systolic blood pressure both rise. Diastolic blood pressure, however, typically does not change significantly. During isometric exercise, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures may increase. In normal individuals, the cardiac output rises four- fold to six- fold above basal levels during maximum exercise. The physiologic response to physical activity often becomes attenuated as an individual ages. The heart rate response to exercise is blunted in the elderly, and the predicted maximum heart rate decreases with age (estimated by 220 minus age in years). This is due in part to decreased beta- adrenergic responsiveness in older individuals. The average stroke volume is preserved in normal older adults, and the observed decline in maximum cardiac output is due primarily to the blunted heart rate response. Maximal aerobic capacity ( \(\mathrm{VO}_2\) max) declines \(8\%\) to \(10\%\) per decade in sedentary individuals, such that there is a \(50\%\) fall between ages 30 and 80 years. Thus, the exercise protocol chosen to test elderly individuals should take into account predicted limitations in external capacity.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 29  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 131, 134; Figs. 13.6 and 13.7; Tables 13.6 and 13.7)  

D (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 131, 134; Figs. 13.6 and 13.7; Tables 13.6 and 13.7)The intensity of a heart murmur is related to the pressure gradient and rate of flow across the responsible orifice. Physiologic changes or bedside maneuvers that alter the driving pressure gradient or the rate of flow lead to audible changes in murmur intensity. In acute mitral regurgitation (MR), flow is directed backward from the left ventricle into a relatively noncompliant left atrium (LA), leading to a rapid increase in left atrial pressure during systole. Because this abolishes the pressure gradient between the left ventricle and LA in late systole, the murmur of acute MR is often present only in early systole. Similarly, in acute aortic regurgitation, the left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure rises rapidly, leading to cessation of the diastolic murmur in mid- to late diastole, as LV and aortic pressures equalize. In patients with mitral valve prolapse, the auscultatory findings vary prominently with physiologic alterations. The valve physically prolapses into the LA, and the associated click/murmur commences when the reduction of LV volume during contraction reaches the point at which the mitral leaflets fail to coapt. Maneuvers that decrease LV volume, such as standing from a squatting position, cause the valve prolapse, the click, and the murmur to all occur earlier in systole. In mitral stenosis, the diastolic rumbling murmur increases with any maneuver that augments transvalvular flow and decreases in situations that reduce transmitral flow, such as the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver.  

The systolic murmurs of aortic valvular stenosis and MR are sometimes difficult to distinguish. However, the intensity of aortic stenosis varies from beat to beat when the duration of diastole is not constant, as in atrial fibrillation or after a premature contraction. The murmur of MR is not affected in this manner, because the changes in driving pressure between the left ventricle and the LA are smaller.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 30  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 244-246; Figs. 16.66 and 16.70)  

C (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 244- 246; Figs. 16.66 and 16.70)This computed tomogram demonstrates a type A aortic dissection involving the ascending (large arrow, A) and descending (small arrows, A) thoracic aorta. In addition, the dissection extends into the aortic arch vessels (large arrows, B), the left common carotid artery (small arrow, B), and the innominate artery (arrowhead, B). Dissection membranes are clearly visualized in the involved segments. Acute aortic dissection is often lethal; survival depends on prompt clinical recognition and definitive imaging of the aorta. Type A aortic dissections involve the ascending aorta. Type B aortic dissections do not involve the ascending aorta. The most common symptom of acute aortic dissection is chest or back pain, reported in up to \(96\%\) of patients. The pain is typically sudden in onset and severe, often with a "ripping" or "tearing" quality. The patient discussed in this question may have also presented with pulse deficits or neurologic symptoms, given the branch artery involvement demonstrated on the computed tomogram. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have outstanding sensitivity for the diagnosis of aortic dissection, on the order of \(96\%\) to \(100\%\) . Transesophageal echocardiography is unnecessary in this case, but it is also an excellent imaging modality for the diagnosis of aortic dissection (sensitivity of \(\sim 98\%\) and specificity of \(94\% - 97\%\) ), with the caveat that visualization of the distal ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch may be limited by interference by the trachea and bronchus. Conversely, the sensitivity of standard transthoracic echocardiography for aortic dissection is relatively poor \((59\% - 85\%)\) . Aortography is rarely necessary and has inferior diagnostic capabilities for aortic dissection compared with CT and MRI. Because of its rapid availability, CT is the initial diagnostic test of choice for suspected aortic dissection in many centers.  

All patients with acute aortic dissection should receive immediate parenteral therapy for hypertension, typically an intravenous beta blocker to additionally provide rate control and reduce aortic wall stress, after which vasodilators can be added as needed to further control blood pressure. Patients with acute type A aortic dissection should be referred for emergent surgery. Surgery is also the treatment of choice for patients with acute type B aortic dissection complicated by vital organ compromise, rupture or impending aortic rupture, retrograde extension into the ascending aorta, or Marfan syndrome. Patients with uncomplicated acute- type B aortic dissections can typically be safely managed initially with parenteral agents for blood pressure control, in- hospital monitoring, and serial imaging of the aorta to assess for retrograde extension or

other indications for surgery, and then conversion to oral antihypertensive therapy.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 31  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 15: p. 182; Fig. 15.3)  

ST- segment displacement is the primary means by which ischemia is detected during standard exercise testing. ST- segment depression is the most common form of abnormal response, whereas ST- segment elevation in a lead without pathologic Q waves is found only in approximately \(1\%\) of patients with obstructive coronary disease. J point depressions with upsloping ST segments are a normal finding during exercise. Patients with ischemic heart disease usually display true ST- segment depression with a horizontal or downsloping configuration. The correct isoelectric reference point for the ST segment is the TP segment. However, because this segment is shortened during exercise, the PQ junction is typically chosen as the reference point instead. In normal individuals who have an early repolarization pattern on the resting ECG, the chronically elevated J point usually returns to baseline during exercise. In this setting, any ST- segment deviations during exercise should be referenced to the PQ junction, not to the original J point position. Ischemic ST- segment depressions may develop only during exercise or may occur during exercise and persist into recovery. In \(10\%\) of patients, ischemic changes are observed only during the recovery phase. The onset of ST- segment changes during recovery occurs more commonly in asymptomatic individuals compared with those with symptomatic coronary artery disease. An abnormal ST- segment response is considered to be \(0.10 \mathrm{mV}\) (1 mm) or greater of J point depression, with a flat or downsloping ST segment that remains depressed to \(0.10 \mathrm{mV}\) or greater at 80 milliseconds after the J point.  

Although ST- segment elevation is helpful to localize ischemia to particular coronary territories, the location of ST- segment depression during exercise does not accurately predict the responsible coronary anatomy.

This ECG demonstrates extreme right- axis deviation of the QRS complex and an abnormally rightward P wave axis (the P waves are inverted in leads I and aVL). Although this pattern may suggest dextrocardia with situs inversus, the normal progression of the R waves in the precordial leads is not consistent with that diagnosis (in dextrocardia, R wave progression would be reversed). Rather, the tracing is most consistent with right and left arm lead reversal, a common error of lead placement. In this situation, the recordings from leads aVL and aVR are interchanged, and the complexes in lead I are the mirror image of what would be expected in that lead had the limb leads been placed correctly. Fig. 1.68 shows the ECG from the same patient with the leads placed correctly.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 33

An understanding of the differences between stress testing protocols is required to choose the appropriate study for a specific patient. Six to 12 minutes of progressive exercise, leading to a level of maximal oxygen consumption, provides the greatest diagnostic and prognostic information. An optimal exercise study is characterized by an appropriate rise in both heart rate and systolic blood pressure. The diastolic blood pressure may fall, rise, or stay the same, depending on the protocol used and the workload achieved. When systolic blood pressure falls during exercise, it is often indicative of severe underlying coronary artery disease (typically three- vessel or left main disease) or severe left ventricular (LV) contractile dysfunction. Other potential causes include LV outflow obstruction (e.g., advanced aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) and hypovolemia.  

Treadmill protocols are the most commonly used form of stress testing and are characterized by achievement of high maximum heart rates and oxygen consumption. Bicycle protocols are sometimes better tolerated by

deconditioned patients because of the ramped nature of the test, and achieve maximum heart rates similar to, but maximal oxygen consumption less than, treadmill tests. Arm crank ergometry can be useful for patients who cannot perform leg exercise, such as patients with severe peripheral arterial disease. Arm protocols typically produce a higher heart rate and blood pressure response for a given workload than leg exercise protocols; however, the maximum heart rate achieved during arm ergometry testing is typically only approximately \(70\%\) of that achieved during treadmill or bicycle tests. Maximal oxygen consumption and minute ventilation are also lower for arm cycling than for leg exercise. The standard treadmill Bruce protocol is the most commonly used, and a large diagnostic and prognostic database has been accumulated with this regimen. The primary limitation of the Bruce protocol is the large increase in oxygen consumption from one stage to the next, which limits the utility of this protocol in elderly, deconditioned, or ill individuals. In such patients a more gradual regimen, such as the Naughton or Weber protocol, using 1- to 2- minute stages with 1- metabolic equivalent increases per stage, or a ramped bicycle protocol with small increases in workload each minute, is typically better tolerated.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 34  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 5: pp.53-54)  

The development of new exertional dyspnea in a patient with cardiac disease may herald progression or a change in the clinical syndrome. Each of the patients in this question has a known, previously asymptomatic cardiac lesion and has recently developed shortness of breath with physical activities. A congenitally bicuspid aortic valve often becomes progressively stenotic with age, and symptoms associated with aortic stenosis (angina, syncope, heart failure) frequently develop in mid- to late adulthood. A patient with a history of myocardial infarction who presents with new dyspnea without recurrent angina is likely to have developed left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to ventricular remodeling. Other potential contributing factors include dyspnea as an anginal equivalent or a superimposed arrhythmia. New irregular palpitations in a patient with a history of rheumatic heart disease may indicate superimposed atrial fibrillation. This is a poorly tolerated complication in patients with mitral stenosis because of the abbreviated LV diastolic filling period during rapid heart rates.  

Most young adults with an uncomplicated ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) have normal exercise tolerance. Previously asymptomatic ostium secundum ASDs, in the absence of pulmonary hypertension, are typically well tolerated during pregnancy. Although problems may arise because of paradoxical embolism in the setting of lower extremity venous thrombosis, symptoms of ventricular dysfunction or reversed shunting across the ASD are rare. Exertional dyspnea in the third trimester of pregnancy in such patients is more likely the result of impaired diaphragmatic excursion from the increasing size of the uterus.  

The most common causes of morbidity and mortality in trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are congenital heart defects, which are present in \(40\%\) to \(50\%\) of patients. The most characteristic abnormalities are endocardial cushion defects, such as ostium primum ASD and "cleft" mitral valve with mitral regurgitation. Approximately one- third of the congenital heart lesions are complex defects that are detected early, but simpler cardiac anomalies may remain unnoticed into adulthood. The onset of exertional dyspnea in a patient with trisomy 21 warrants evaluation for such lesions.

This patient has symptomatic, severe low- gradient aortic stenosis with normal left ventricular systolic function. The calculated aortic valve area is \(\leq 1.0 \mathrm{cm}^2\) , but the peak transaortic valve velocity is less than \(4 \mathrm{m / seconds}\) , and the mean gradient is less than \(40 \mathrm{mm Hg}\) . The stroke volume index is \(35 \mathrm{mL / m}^2\) or higher, indicating normal volume outflow. The 2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease guidelines recommend that, in patients with suspected low- gradient severe aortic stenosis, measurement of aortic valve calcium score by computed tomography imaging is appropriate to further define severity. Sex- specific Agatston unit thresholds for diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis are approximately 1300 in women and approximately 2000 in men. This patient's aortic valve calcium score is 2531 Agatston units (yellow color delineates dense aortic valve calcifications in the figure). Therefore, the diagnosis of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis is reinforced for this patient, and the next appropriate step in management is aortic valve replacement. In patients with suspected low- flow, low- gradient severe aortic stenosis with reduced LV ejection fraction, low- dose dobutamine stress echocardiography or invasive hemodynamic measurements would be reasonable to further define aortic stenosis severity and assess contractile reserve. In asymptomatic patients with suspected advanced aortic stenosis, exercise testing is appropriate to assess physiologic changes with exertion and to confirm whether symptoms are truly absent. However, exercise testing is not recommended for symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis.

Certain resting image patterns seen after acute MI, such as increased lung uptake of radioisotope, have been associated with an unfavorable prognosis, because they are indicative of impaired left ventricular (LV) function.  

Pharmacologic stress testing with nuclear imaging after an acute MI has been shown to be safe and to predict in- hospital and late cardiac complications better than submaximal exercise stress imaging. Gated single- photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging allows for determination of LV function, which adds additional prognostic information in the management of the postinfarction patient.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 37  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 15: p. 183; Fig. 15.3; see also Answer to Question 31)  

The development of ST- segment elevation during exercise testing is predictive of the presence of transmural ischemia owing to vasospasm or a high- grade coronary narrowing. It is very uncommon, occurring in only approximately \(1\%\) of patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. In contrast to ST- segment depression, the development of ST- segment elevation is useful in localizing the anatomic site of ischemia and typically correlates with a perfusion defect on imaging studies. In patients with early repolarization, the normal response is for elevated J points to return to baseline during exercise.  

ST- segment elevation during exercise testing does not have predictive significance when it occurs in leads that contain pathologic Q waves. In that situation, it may represent a region of myocardial scar with a resting wall motion abnormality. There is no direct association between exercise- induced ST- segment elevation and the development of conduction system abnormalities.

Assessment of coronary artery calcification by electron beam tomography (EBT) using electrocardiographic gating is a technique to screen for coronary artery disease (CAD). Although coronary artery calcification is a surrogate marker for coronary atherosclerotic plaque, the correlation between the amount of coronary calcium and the actual angiographic severity of the CAD is weak. The complete absence of coronary calcification on EBT has a strong negative predictive value for high- grade coronary stenosis but does not completely rule out the presence of significant CAD. The Agatston score is the most frequently used system for reporting the severity of coronary artery calcifications, and reference data sets for interpretation are stratified by age and gender. Annual rates of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death rise with increasing Agatston scores, even in patients with similar Framingham risk scores. Coronary EBT is of most clinical value for patients who are at intermediate risk for coronary events based on traditional cardiovascular risk factors and for whom an abnormal scan will have an impact on clinical management.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 39  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 18: pp. 290-291; Fig. 18.17)  

Myocardial perfusion imaging provides an important source of prognostic information in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Stress myocardial perfusion imaging has been shown to be a powerful predictor of subsequent cardiac events. The combination of clinical and myocardial perfusion data is more predictive than the combination of clinical and cardiac catheterization data. Indeed, even when angiographic CAD is present, a normal myocardial perfusion study confers a very low risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event ( \(< 1\%\) per year).  

Stress perfusion defects in multiple locations corresponding to multiple vascular territories are suggestive of left main or three- vessel CAD. Other indicators of high- risk CAD include large defects, transient pulmonary uptake of tracer, and left ventricular cavity dilatation with exercise. The severity of a myocardial perfusion defect can be assessed in terms of both its size and the extent of its reversibility. The severity of defects, as well as their number and size, are important indicators of prognosis. The predictive value of myocardial perfusion imaging is independent of the imaging technique (planar or single- photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) and the imaging agent used (e.g., thallium- 201- or technetium- 99m- based compounds), with one important exception: there is a decreased likelihood of significant breast attenuation artifact with the use of technetium- 99m- based agents with ECG- gated SPECT imaging.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an excellent technique to define pericardial anatomy and abnormalities. It is highly sensitive for the detection of pericardial fluid, masses, and pericardial thickening. The T1- weighted spin- echo CMR image in this case demonstrates diffuse encasement of the heart by a structure within the pericardium that has intermediate signal intensity resembling myocardial tissue (labeled with

asterisks in Fig. 1.69). The features are most consistent with pericardial malignancy.  

Biopsy of the affected region demonstrated pericardial angiosarcoma. This is a rare primary pericardial malignancy that arises from the pericardial vasculature and typically does not metastasize. However, it usually proliferates widely throughout the pericardial cavity and may invade the myocardium. This case was inoperable at surgery, and the patient died 4 days after presentation.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 41  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 22: pp. 403-404)  

In the presence of an intracardiac shunt, blood flows abnormally between the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Although many shunts are detected by noninvasive means, certain findings during right and left heart catheterization may point to unexpected intracardiac communications. For example, suspicion for a left- to- right shunt should be raised if the pulmonary artery (PA) oxygen saturation exceeds \(80\%\) , or if the difference in oxygen saturation between the superior vena cava (SVC) and the PA is \(8\%\) or more. A right- to- left shunt should be considered if the systemic arterial saturation is less than \(93\%\) without any other reason.  

Normally, the oxygen saturation in the inferior vena cava (IVC) is higher than that in the SVC. Mixed venous saturation is usually most accurately determined in the PA, because complete mixing of venous return has occurred at that level. However, when assessing a transatrial shunt, the mixed venous saturation must be determined proximal to the shunt and can be estimated by the Flamm formula, measuring oxygen content in the SVC and IVC:  

Mixed venous oxygen content \(= \frac{3(\mathrm{SVC}O_2\mathrm{content}) + 1(\mathrm{IVCO}_2\mathrm{content})}{4}\)  

The ratio of pulmonic to systemic blood flow \((Q_{\mathrm{p}} / Q_{\mathrm{s}})\) is used to determine the significance of an intracardiac shunt. A \(Q_{\mathrm{p}} / Q_{\mathrm{s}}\) of less than 1.0 indicates net right- to- left shunting. A \(Q_{\mathrm{p}} / Q_{\mathrm{s}}\) of 2.0 or more indicates a large left- to- right shunt that generally requires repair. A \(Q_{\mathrm{p}} / Q_{\mathrm{s}}\) of 1.0 to 1.5 indicates a small left- to- right shunt.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 221-222; Fig. 16.28; Ch 54: Figs. 54.5 and 54.11)  

The pulsed- wave Doppler spectrum in the illustration demonstrates late systolic acceleration of flow characteristic of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, typically seen in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This abnormal Doppler signal ("dagger" pattern) is detected in the LVOT and peaks significantly later than that of valvular aortic stenosis, owing to the dynamic nature of the obstruction. Because the disorder is at the subvalvular level, there is no therapeutic role for aortic valve surgery.  

The LVOT obstruction may be worsened by any action that decreases left ventricular volume and narrows the distance between the interventricular septum and the anterior mitral leaflet, including volume depletion. Bed rest has no specific role in the management of HCM.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 43  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 240-241; Figs. 16.58 and 16.60-16.62)  

Echocardiography is an excellent technique to detect and grossly quantify the volume of pericardial effusions. The normal pericardial space contains 35 to \(50~\mathrm{mL}\) of serous fluid between the visceral and parietal pericardial layers. Small pathologic effusions tend to accumulate posteriorly, external to the left ventricular free wall, because of the effects of gravity. Larger effusions tend to circumscribe the heart. Certain echocardiographic features are good indicators of the presence of cardiac tamponade physiology in patients with pericardial effusion. These include early diastolic collapse of the right ventricle, which indicates the presence of elevated intrapericardial pressure (see Braunwald, Ch 16: Fig. 16.60). However, right ventricular (RV) diastolic collapse may be absent in clinical tamponade if pulmonary hypertension or RV hypertrophy is present, because these forces oppose RV indentation. Diastolic invagination of the right atrium (see Braunwald, Ch. 16: Fig. 16.60) is a more sensitive, but less specific, marker of tamponade physiology. Doppler interrogation can also provide clues to the presence of tamponade, including exaggerated respiratory variation of transvalvular velocities (see Answer to Question 6).  

Transthoracic echocardiographic imaging is often inadequate in direct assessment of the thickness of the pericardium; transesophageal echocardiography, computed

tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are more accurate techniques for this purpose.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 44  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 18: pp. 280-281, 282, 291-292, 299-301)  

Although nuclear stress testing is commonly used in the evaluation of women with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), there is the possibility of breast attenuation artifact in female patients. The use of technetium- 99m- based agents with single- photon emission computer tomography imaging and electrocardiographic gating reduce the likelihood of a false- positive study due to such artifact, thereby increasing the specificity of nuclear testing in women. Breast attenuation artifact typically appears as a fixed defect of the anterior or anterolateral wall. If this defect is due to artifact rather than prior infarction, the involved segment(s) will demonstrate normal wall motion on the gated images (see Answer to Question 11).  

Patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) may demonstrate artifactual exercise- induced perfusion defects, especially in the septal and anteroapical regions. Pharmacologic stress testing with adenosine, regadenoson, or dipyridamole minimizes the incidence of such artifacts. Thus, it is recommended that patients with complete LBBB on the ECG be evaluated by vasodilatory agents, rather than an exercise protocol, to avoid false- positive results.  

Nuclear imaging is a useful modality for preoperative risk stratification before noncardiac surgery, especially for patients at intermediate clinical risk. For example, vasodilator stress testing with perfusion imaging is predictive of perioperative cardiac events and the magnitude of risk correlates with the extent of ischemia. Patients with diabetes are at increased risk for CAD and its complications, and perfusion defects during testing predict higher event rates in diabetics compared with nondiabetics.  

In patients with CAD, assessment of myocardial viability may be of importance in defining revascularization options. Modalities for the determination of myocardial viability include thallium- 201 imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, dobutamine echocardiography, and positron emission tomography.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 19: p. 320)  

In this delayed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image, the midseptum and midanterior segments of the left ventricle demonstrate subendocardial late enhancement (the bright area indicated by the white arrows in Fig. 1.70) that involves approximately half of the transmural thickness of the myocardium. This finding, as well as the matching wall motion abnormality by echocardiography, is most consistent with a prior nontransmural myocardial infarction (MI). The presence of MI (acute or old) can be determined accurately using the protocol of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Gadolinium is an extracellular contrast agent that only minimally enters normal myocardial cells. However, disrupted myocardium after an MI allows expansion of the volume of distribution and delayed entry of the contrast agent into the affected region. A subendocardial distribution is indicative of MI. Both conventional CMR and LGE are useful in assessing myocardial viability. For example, improved wall thickening with low-dose dobutamine CMR correlates well with the presence of viable myocardium. Using LGE, a transmural extent of MI (i.e., region of late enhancement) of less than \(50\%\) is also predictive of functional recovery after revascularization.

As with most stenotic valvular lesions, echocardiographic evaluation of aortic stenosis (AS) is accurate and clinically useful. The morphology of the valve can be examined by two- dimensional imaging to assess for congenital or rheumatic abnormalities or age- related changes of valvular architecture. The peak outflow velocity is then measured using continuous- wave Doppler imaging. Important AS usually results in outflow velocities of \(3.5 \mathrm{m / second}\) or greater, which is out of the range for accurate quantification by

<--- Page Split --->

pulsed- wave Doppler imaging. From the continuous- wave Doppler measurement, both the peak and mean gradients can be determined. The peak instantaneous gradient measured by Doppler reflects the true maximum pressure difference between the left ventricle and aorta. The peak- to- peak gradient measured in the catheterization laboratory has no actual physiologic basis and does not directly correspond to the echocardiographically measured values—the peak instantaneous gradient routinely exceeds the peak- to- peak valve gradient. Conversely, the mean gradients determined noninvasively and in the catheterization laboratory show excellent agreement, because they both measure the difference in pressure between the left ventricular (LV) and aorta averaged throughout systole.  

The aortic valve area can be calculated using the continuity equation (see Braunwald, Ch 16: Fig. 16.44), comparing the volume rate of flow across the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) with that through the aortic valve. The greatest potential error introduced into this calculation resides in inaccurate measurement of the LVOT diameter. In practice, a peak transaortic valvular gradient greater than \(50\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) correlates with clinically significant AS. Similarly, a patient with normal LV contractile function and a low gradient is unlikely to have significant stenosis. However, in the presence of impaired LV function, a more modest gradient (corresponding to transvalvular velocities of \(2 - 3\mathrm{m / }\) second) may be clinically important, and calculation of the aortic valve area by the continuity equation can be helpful in this case.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 47  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 22: pp. 403-404)  

Detection and localization of intracardiac shunts is possible at catheterization by a traditional oximetry run, in which samples are drawn at numerous sites in the right side of the heart and adjacent vessels. The technique involves measurement of \(\mathrm{O}_2\) saturations to identify a significant step- up between consecutive chambers. Using averaged samples, an \(\mathrm{O}_2\) saturation step- up of \(8\%\) or more is typically necessary to diagnose a left- to- right shunt at the atrial level, whereas one of \(5\%\) or more suffices at the level of the right ventricle or pulmonary artery (PA). This is because \(\mathrm{O}_2\) content in different portions of the right atrium may vary by as much as \(2\%\) , reflecting the streaming of blood that enters from the superior vena cava, the inferior vena cava, and the coronary sinus.  

The data obtained in the course of an oximetry run may be used to quantify shunt size. Pulmonary and systemic blood flows can be calculated using the standard Fick equation. The ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow \((\mathrm{Q}_p / \mathrm{Q}_s)\) is used to determine the significance of a shunt. A \(\mathrm{Q}_p / \mathrm{Q}_s\) of less than 1.5 indicates a small left- to- right shunt. A \(\mathrm{Q}_p / \mathrm{Q}_s\) of 2.0 or more indicates a large left- to- right shunt that generally warrants closure. Because of normal variability in \(\mathrm{O}_2\) saturation, left- to- right shunts with \(\mathrm{Q}_p / \mathrm{Q}_s\) of 1.3 or less at the PA or right ventricular levels, and those with \(\mathrm{Q}_p / \mathrm{Q}_s\) less than 1.5 at the atrial level may not be detected. A \(\mathrm{Q}_p / \mathrm{Q}_s\) of less than 1.0 indicates a net right- to- left shunt. For unidirectional shunts, the magnitude of the shunt can also be expressed by the difference \(\mathrm{Q}_p - \mathrm{Q}_s\) . From this calculation, it can be deduced that a negative value will occur with pure right- to- left shunts.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 15: pp. 181-183, 185; Fig. 15.3)  

The exercise ECG is very likely to be abnormal in patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD). There are several abnormalities that are suggestive of multivessel CAD and an adverse prognosis. These include the early onset of ischemic ST- segment depression, such as during the first stage of a standard Bruce protocol. In addition, ST- segment depression of \(2\mathrm{mm}\) or more \((0.20\mathrm{mV})\) involving five or more leads, or persisting 5 or more minutes into recovery, is suggestive of more severe underlying coronary atherosclerosis. Exercise- induced ST- segment elevation is also consistent with multivessel CAD, except in lead aVR, which may demonstrate ST- segment elevation in less severe coronary disease. A failure to increase systolic blood pressure by \(10\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) or a sustained decrease in systolic blood pressure of \(10\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) or more, is suggestive of multivessel (or left main) CAD and an adverse prognosis. Multifocal premature ventricular contractions occurring during exercise are not correlated with extensive disease, but sustained or symptomatic ventricular tachycardia is predictive of multivessel CAD.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 49  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 131, 134, 137; Tables 13.6 and 13.7; Fig. 13.7)  

Squatting increases venous return to the heart and ventricular stroke volume. The resultant augmented flow and turbulence across the stenotic aortic valve increase the intensity of the murmur. In distinction, during the early phase of the Valsalva maneuver, venous return (and therefore stroke volume) is decreased so that the intensity of the murmur of aortic stenosis (AS) lessens.  

The systolic murmur of AS can be confused with mitral regurgitation (MR). However, if the patient has an irregular rhythm or premature ventricular contractions, beat- to- beat variations in diastolic filling of the left ventricle result in changes of the intensity of the AS murmur, whereas the murmur of MR does not demonstrate such variability. Respiration has little effect on the intensity of left- sided heart murmurs, including AS, but can accentuate most right- sided murmurs, including tricuspid regurgitation.

This man has classic findings of chest discomfort caused by esophageal reflux and spasm. Differentiation of esophageal disorders from ischemic heart disease can

<--- Page Split --->

be difficult because the sensations are often located in similar areas, and both can be associated with emotional stress. However, although each condition may produce substernal burning, features in this case are more suggestive of an esophageal rather than cardiac origin. These include a prolonged continuous ache, a discomfort that is primarily retrosternal but does not radiate toward the arms, and the fact the symptom is not precipitated by exercise but occurs while recumbent. Classically, esophageal disease associated with regurgitation causes "water brash," a taste in the mouth consistent with regurgitation of gastric contents. Frequently, patients with esophageal spasm experience some relief with nitroglycerin. Unlike angina due to myocardial ischemia, however, esophageal pain is often relieved by milk, antacids, or food. Biliary colic also may be confused with angina pectoris. It is usually caused by a rapid rise in biliary pressure due to obstruction of the cystic or bile ducts. Thus, the pain is usually abrupt in onset and steady in nature and lasts from minutes to hours. In many cases, the discomfort is described as colicky. It should be suspected when a history of dyspepsia, fatty food intolerance, and indigestion is present.  

The chest discomfort of pericarditis is typically described as sharp, stabbing, or knife- like. Pain due to pericarditis is often localized in the substernal or apical areas and can radiate to the neck or left shoulder. The pain is often worsened by deep breathing or lying in a supine position. Patients may find relief from the chest discomfort of pericarditis by sitting up and leaning forward.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 51  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 18: pp. 287-288; Fig. 18.10; Table 18.4)  

The perfusion images display a large region of reversible ischemia in the anteroseptal territory, in the distribution of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In addition, compared with the rest images, there are additional postexercise abnormalities, including dilatation of the left ventricular (LV) cavity (best seen on the short- axis images), increased right ventricular (RV) tracer uptake (most evident in the horizontal long- axis images), and increased lung uptake. Transient dilatation of the LV cavity after stress is associated with extensive and severe coronary artery disease (CAD). It is thought to represent diffuse subendocardial ischemia resulting in an apparent LV dilatation, rather than true cavity enlargement. Increased pulmonary radiotracer uptake after stress is a marker of elevated LV end- diastolic pressure and is predictive of a poor prognosis. It is usually associated with multivessel CAD, depressed LV function, and extensive ischemia. Increased RV tracer uptake on the poststress images, compared with the rest images, is a specific marker of severe multivessel or left main disease. Finally, a fall in systolic blood pressure of \(10\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) or more during exercise is also predictive of left main or three- vessel CAD. In this case, all of these findings are present, along with a large and severe reversible perfusion defect, indicative of severe CAD despite failure to achieve the target heart rate.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 231-232; Figs. 16.43, 16.44, and 16.46; eFigs. 16.27 and 16.28)  

The Doppler tracing was obtained across the left ventricular outflow tract of a patient with combined aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic insufficiency. The tracing shows a characteristic delayed onset of peak velocity, consistent with significant AS. The pressure gradient across the aortic valve can be calculated using the modified Bernoulli equation (pressure gradient \(= 4 \times \mathrm{V}^2\) ). The peak velocity across the aortic valve of approximately \(4.8\mathrm{m / second}\) in the figure corresponds to an instantaneous peak systolic gradient of \(92\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) . In general, when the aortic flow velocity is greater than \(4\mathrm{m / second}\) , the probability of critical AS is high. In contrast, an aortic flow velocity less than \(3\mathrm{m / second}\) is usually associated with only mild AS. For aortic flow velocities that are intermediate, echocardiographic calculation of the aortic valve area or additional hemodynamic data are often needed.  

The diastolic flow on this tracing represents aortic insufficiency. Severe aortic insufficiency is associated with a rapidly declining flow velocity, whereas mild aortic insufficiency demonstrates a gradually declining velocity. In this case, the decline in diastolic velocity is gradual, and the degree of aortic insufficiency is likely mild. Premature diastolic closure of the mitral valve may be observed in patients with severe, acute aortic insufficiency owing to the greatly elevated diastolic left ventricular (LV) pressure; it would not be expected in this patient given the mild degree of aortic insufficiency present.  

Additional findings on the echocardiogram that may help assess the severity of aortic valve disease include measurements of LV size and thickness. In this patient with severe AS, one would expect to find concentric LV hypertrophy.

Many congenital and acquired cardiac diseases are associated with abnormalities of the extremities. Arachnodactyly (abnormally long and slender digits) is a manifestation of Marfan syndrome. A common finding in arachnodactyly is that when a clenched fist is made around the thumb, the latter extends beyond the ulnar side of the hand (the "thumb sign"). Characteristic extremity abnormalities associated with Turner syndrome include short stature and bowed arms. It is the Holt- Oram syndrome that consists of an atrial septal defect and skeletal abnormalities, including deformities of the radius and ulna, and a "fingerized" thumb (i.e., the thumb has an extra phalanx).  

Quincke sign, systolic flushing of the nail beds, is common in chronic aortic regurgitation and other conditions with a widened pulse pressure.

Osler nodes are small, tender erythematous skin lesions observed primarily on the pads of the fingers and toes but also on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They result from infective microemboli in patients with endocarditis. In contrast, Janeway lesions are slightly raised, nontender, hemorrhagic lesions on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet that may also appear in patients with infective endocarditis. Both types of lesions were more common in the preantibiotic era.  

Differential cyanosis is the condition in which the hands and fingers are pink but the feet and toes are cyanotic. It is typical of patent ductus arteriosus with pulmonary hypertension and a reversed shunt, in which case desaturated blood is directed to the lower body.

The echocardiographic image is an apical four- chamber view of a patient with Ebstein anomaly. Ebstein anomaly is a congenital malformation of the tricuspid valve characterized by elongation and tethering of the anterior leaflet ("sail- like" appearance) and apical displacement of a diminutive septal leaflet. This anomaly results in conversion of a portion of the right ventricle into an "atrialized" right ventricle. There is typically severe right atrial enlargement. Because of the structural deformity of the tricuspid valve, varying degrees of tricuspid regurgitation, and occasionally tricuspid stenosis, are present. The symptomatic presentation of patients with Ebstein anomaly depends on the severity of the valvular regurgitation and the presence of additional congenital heart lesions.  

Ebstein anomaly is associated with a number of other congenital heart defects, including patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect in approximately \(50\%\) of patients. Up to \(25\%\) of patients with Ebstein anomaly have an accessory conduction pathway (Wolff- Parkinson- White pattern on the ECG), which is typically right- sided. Atrial arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, are common.  

Although coarctation of the aorta can rarely be associated with Ebstein anomaly, systemic hypertension is not a common finding among patients with this disorder.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 248-252; Fig. 16.74)  

Echocardiography plays a key role in the diagnosis and evaluation of infective endocarditis. The echocardiographic hallmark is the presence of a valvular vegetation, which is a collection of thrombus, necrotic valvular debris, inflammatory material, and bacteria. Typically, vegetations are located on the atrial aspect of atrioventricular (mitral, tricuspid) valves and the ventricular aspect of the semilunar (aortic, pulmonic) valves; however, large and aggressive lesions may involve both surfaces of the involved valve. The sensitivity of transthoracic echocardiography for detection of vegetations is only approximately \(63\%\) . Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive for detection of small vegetations ( \(94\% - 100\%\) sensitive). However, there is little additional diagnostic yield of TEE when a high- quality transthoracic study is completely normal, without evidence of valve thickening or pathologic regurgitation. Echocardiography also plays a critical role in the identification of structural and functional impairments that result from endocarditis. The degree of valvular destruction and regurgitation can be assessed, particularly with TEE, but TEE is not mandatory if a high- quality transthoracic study provides all relevant information. TEE is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography for identification of myocardial abscess formation, valvular perforation, chordal rupture, and endocarditis of prosthetic valves.   

Echocardiography can assist in determining whether corrective surgical intervention is appropriate in endocarditis, but the decision to operate should be made primarily on clinical grounds. Factors that predict poor outcome and favor earlier surgical intervention include a perivalvular abscess, intractable heart failure due to valve dysfunction, very large ( \(>1 \mathrm{cm}\) ) and hypermobile vegetations, recurrent embolic events despite antibiotic therapy, infection by aggressive organisms, or persistent bacteremia.  

Residual vegetation often is persistent despite treatment and bacteriologic cure, and it is the patient's clinical status, as well as repeat blood cultures after completion of an appropriate antibiotic course, that should dictate further clinical decision making.

The volume and contour of the arterial pulse depend in part on the left ventricular stroke volume, the ejection velocity, and the compliance and capacity of the arterial system. Pulsus parvus et tardus—a small pulse with a delayed systolic peak—is characteristically seen in severe aortic stenosis (AS) and is best appreciated by palpating the carotid artery rather than a peripheral vessel such as the brachial artery. In patients with severe AS and congestive heart failure, the delayed upstroke is not usually evident, leaving only pulsus parvus.  

Pulsus biseriens, characterized by two systolic peaks, occurs when a large stroke volume is ejected rapidly from the ventricle. It is typical of pure aortic regurgitation (AR) and of AR combined with AS. It is also seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with dynamic outflow obstruction.  

The peripheral pulse rate of rise, contour, and volume is best appreciated by palpation of the brachial artery. The

<--- Page Split --->

carotid pulse provides the most accurate representation of the central aortic pulse.  

In coarctation of the aorta, the carotid and brachial pulses are usually bounding and rapidly rising and have large volumes. Conversely, the lower extremity pulses, such as at the femoral artery, have reduced systolic and pulse pressures with a slow rate of rise and a late peak. The femoral artery delay can be appreciated by palpating the brachial and femoral arteries simultaneously.  

The normal aorta is often palpable only above the umbilicus. If the aorta is palpable below the umbilicus, an abdominal aortic aneurysm should be suspected.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 21: pp.364-367; eFig.21.1)  

Over 1 million diagnostic cardiac catheterizations are performed annually in the United States.1 Common vascular entry sites include the femoral and radial artery approaches. To decrease the risk of retroperitoneal hemorrhage when using the femoral artery approach, the puncture of the common femoral artery should be made below the inguinal ligament but proximal to the bifurcation of the superficial femoral and profunda arterial branches. If the puncture site is proximal to the inguinal ligament, it may be difficult to establish hemostasis with manual compression. If the puncture site is distal to the bifurcation, there is an increased risk for the formation of a pseudoaneurysm after sheath removal.  

For patients on warfarin anticoagulation, the international normalized ratio (INR) should generally be less than 1.8 at the time of the procedure to minimize bleeding when the femoral artery approach is used. An INR of less than 2.2 is acceptable for radial artery access.  

Patients with a history of shellfish allergy are not at higher risk of contrast media reactions than patients with other types of food allergies. The allergens in shellfish are non- iodine- containing proteins (e.g., tropomyosin).2

## A (Braunwald, Ch 15: p.175; Figs. 15.1 and 15.2)  

Exercise testing and exercise training play a critical role in the care of patients with advanced congestive heart failure. It has been demonstrated that peak oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold, measured during cardiopulmonary exercise testing, provide independent prognostic information in this population and are superior to measures such as ejection fraction or functional class in predicting outcome. Patients with severely depressed ejection fractions exhibit a wide range of exercise capacities, with some being near normal, and exercise testing can be critical to quantifying the true functional limitation. A peak oxygen consumption of less than \(14~\mathrm{mL / kg / minute}\) has been shown to predict poor survival and to identify a population in whom mortality is improved by cardiac transplantation. Patients at this level of impairment demonstrate a profound exercise limitation, with maximal exercise capacity being required for activities such as walking, playing golf, or raking leaves. Such a patient would be unable to complete stage I on a standard Bruce protocol. Conversely, patients who achieve a peak oxygen consumption of greater than \(14~\mathrm{mL / kg / minute}\) have a mortality rate similar to patients who have undergone transplantation and would be less likely to benefit from that intervention.   

The exercise limitation in patients with congestive heart failure is correlated most strongly with alterations in skeletal muscle metabolism. Abnormalities in autonomic and ventilatory responsiveness, increased lactate production, and inability to augment cardiac output are also contributing factors. All of these limitations improve with exercise training, and long- term moderate exercise has been shown to benefit functional capacity, reduce symptoms, and enhance quality of life.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 59  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 19: pp.320-322)  

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a powerful noninvasive tool for the diagnosis of several heart and vascular disorders. CMR provides outstanding image quality and reproducibility, as well as attractive safety features (i.e., no need for ionizing radiation exposure or iodinated contrast). CMR is well suited for identification of congenital heart lesions and cardiac tumors, assessment of myocardial infarction and viability, and characterization of cardiomyopathies. \(\mathrm{T2^*}\) mapping is a well- validated technique for measuring tissue iron content. It is used to identify iron overload in patients with beta- thalassemia and to guide chelation therapy. CMR defines the structure and function of the right ventricle and is useful in the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. CMR is also helpful in the evaluation of stenotic and regurgitant valves when echocardiographic windows are inadequate. The use of CMR for pharmacologic myocardial perfusion imaging and dobutamine stress testing is another important clinical application. Compared with nuclear imaging, CMR myocardial perfusion imaging is not limited by attenuation artifacts, does not require ionizing radiation, and has higher spatial resolution.  

Although CMR can accurately measure global left ventricular function with excellent reproducibility, echocardiography remains the superior option for the patient described in answer D, in light of cost and patient comfort issues (e.g., breath holding, confined space, and relatively lengthy scan times for CMR).  

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is an excellent imaging technique for assessment of the aorta and

<--- Page Split --->

peripheral arteries, and coarctation of the aorta can be readily characterized by this technique. MRA has also been validated for the noninvasive diagnosis of renal artery stenosis and is the screening test of choice for this condition at many medical centers.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 5: p. 56; Figs. 5.6 and 5.7)  

The figure demonstrates the impact of pretest probability on prognostic information that can be determined from a positive or negative stress test. The test provides the greatest impact on patients whose pretest probability is in an intermediate range—in such patients, a negative test results in a much lower post- test probability than pretest probability, whereas a positive test results in a much higher post- test probability relative to the pretest probability. For patients who have a high pretest probability, the posttest probability that disease is present remains high even if the test is negative (i.e., there is a high likelihood that the result is a false negative). In such patients, the negative predictive value of the test is low. Similarly, for patients who have a low pretest probability, the positive predictive value of the test is low.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 221-222; Fig. 16.28; Ch 54: Fig. 54.5)  

In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with outflow tract obstruction, the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is abnormally drawn toward the hypertrophied interventricular septum during systole. This systolic anterior motion of the valve can be readily identified by echocardiography (see Braunwald, Ch 16: Fig. 16.28) and plays an integral role in the development of outflow tract obstruction in this condition. In addition, characteristic systolic, not diastolic, notching of the aortic valve is often evident, particularly by M- mode recordings, owing to the dynamic nature of the obstruction. Asymmetric hypertrophy of the interventricular septum is common in HCM and is readily identifiable by echocardiography. However, pathologic localized hypertrophy in this condition can instead be confined to the apex, lateral, or inferior segments, typically without dynamic outflow obstruction at those locations. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is complementary to echocardiography by visualizing regions that are difficult to assess by echocardiography.  

The Doppler spectral mitral inflow pattern in HCM can be variable, but usually reflects the abnormal diastolic filling of the hypertrophied ventricle. Usually there is evidence of a diminished E wave and prominent A wave. Doppler tissue imaging typically demonstrates reduced early diastolic mitral annular velocities \((\mathrm{E}^{\prime})\) as a measure of impaired myocardial relaxation.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 62  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 22: pp. 395-396; Figs. 22.15 and 22.16)  

As summarized in the Answer to Question 23, the right atrial pressure waveform contains three upward deflections \((a,c,\) and \(\mathcal{U}\) waves) and two downward deflections \((x\) and \(y\) descents). The \(a\) wave represents atrial systole and occurs after the P wave on the ECG. The \(x\) descent represents the relaxation of the atrium and downward tugging of the tricuspid annulus by right ventricular contraction. The \(c\) wave interrupts the \(x\) descent and represents the protrusion of the closed tricuspid valve into the right atrium (RA). The \(\mathcal{U}\) wave represents the passive venous filling of the atrium, which occurs during ventricular systole. The height of the \(\mathcal{U}\) wave reflects atrial compliance. In the left atrium, as opposed to the RA, the \(\mathcal{U}\) wave is generally more prominent than the \(a\) wave. The \(y\) descent follows the \(\mathcal{U}\) wave, and it represents right atrial emptying after the tricuspid valve opens.  

Conditions that blunt the right atrial \(y\) descent include cardiac tamponade, ventricular ischemia, and tricuspid stenosis. Conversely, constrictive pericarditis is associated with prominence of the \(y\) descent, because the very earliest phase of diastolic ventricular filling is unimpeded in this condition.  

Blunting of the \(x\) descent can be observed in atrial fibrillation.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 63  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 131, 134; Figs. 13.6 and 13.7; Table 13.7)  

Dynamic auscultation is the technique of altering circulatory dynamics with physiologic maneuvers to determine the effect on cardiac murmurs. Typical maneuvers include the Valsalva maneuver, squatting, standing, isometric exercise, and inspiration/expiration.  

Patent ductus arteriosus causes a continuous murmur that is loudest at the second left intercostal space. The diastolic phase of this murmur is increased by isometric handgrip as a result of augmented systemic vascular resistance (SVR).  

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is associated with a harsh, crescendo- decrescendo systolic murmur best heard between the apex and left sternal border. Actions that reduce left ventricular (LV) size, such as standing or the strain phase of a Valsalva maneuver, bring the anterior mitral leaflet and the interventricular septum into closer proximity, thus intensifying the murmur. These maneuvers are useful in differentiating hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy from a fixed orifice obstruction (i.e., aortic stenosis), in which the murmur softens with standing or the Valsalva maneuver.  

The murmur of an uncomplicated ventricular septal defect is holosystolic because LV systolic pressure and

<--- Page Split --->

systemic resistance exceed right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary resistance throughout systole. Isometric handgrip increases SVR and may further intensify the murmur.  

Aortic regurgitation is a diastolic murmur best appreciated with the patient sitting forward and holding a deep expiration. The murmur may be accentuated by maneuvers that increase the arterial pressure, such as isometric handgrip.  

The diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis is a low- pitched, rumbling murmur best heard at the apex. Maneuvers that increase the rate of transmitral flow, including exercise, accentuate the murmur.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 64  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 14: pp. 168-170; Fig. 14.43)  

Although the findings on this ECG may suggest myocardial ischemia, the deeply inverted T waves are typical of acute cerebrovascular conditions, including subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given the presenting symptoms of headache, nausea, and dizziness, a cranial imaging study such as computed tomography should be obtained rapidly. In this scenario, antiplatelet agents and antithrombotic therapy should be withheld until intracranial bleeding has been excluded. In the absence of findings to suggest unstable myocardial ischemia, antischemic therapies and cardiac catheterization are not initially appropriate. Electrocardiographic abnormalities are present in a large percentage of patients with acute cerebral events. These abnormalities may include tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias, conduction disturbances, repolarization abnormalities that resemble myocardial ischemia, prolongation of the QT interval, and prominent U waves. The mechanisms responsible for such electrocardiographic changes are unknown but appear to be related to abnormal autonomic nervous system function. Myocardial damage with release of serum markers (cardiac- specific troponins, CK- MB) and subendocardial hemorrhage can be observed in the setting of acute severe cerebrovascular disease, believed to be related to the release of excessive local myocardial catecholamines.  

In the appropriate clinical situation, diffuse deep T wave inversions are also found in some patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Giant inverted T waves in the midprecordial leads are particularly characteristic of the apical form of HCM.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 65  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 132-134; Fig. 13.7; Table 13.6)  

Diastolic murmurs are classified according to their time of onset as early diastolic, mid- diastolic, or late diastolic. Early diastolic murmurs include aortic regurgitation (AR) and pulmonic regurgitation (PR). AR begins with the aortic component of the second heart sound \((S_{2})\) , and PR starts with the pulmonic component of \(S_{2}\) . Mid- and late diastolic murmurs begin at a clear interval after \(S_{2}\) . When the murmur of AR radiates selectively to the right sternal border (and not the left sternal border), it implies that aortic root dilatation, rather than aortic valve disease, is the cause.   

The murmur of acute severe AR differs importantly from the murmur of chronic severe AR. The high- pitched murmur of chronic AR begins with the aortic component of \(S_{2}\) and has an early peak and a dominant decrescendo pattern throughout diastole. In contrast, in acute severe AR (e.g., caused by infective endocarditis or aortic dissection), the diastolic murmur is of short duration and tends to be soft, because the aortic diastolic pressure rapidly equilibrates with the steep rise in diastolic left ventricular pressure.  

Presystolic accentuation of diastolic murmurs, owing to atrial activation and a transient increase in driving pressure, is typical of patients with mitral or tricuspid stenosis who are in sinus rhythm. Such accentuation is absent in atrial fibrillation because of the lack of organized atrial contraction.  

When PR develops in the setting of pulmonary hypertension, the murmur begins with a loud \(P_{2}\) and may last throughout diastole (the Graham Steell murmur).

The left main coronary artery arises from the superior portion of the left aortic sinus. It ranges from \(3\) to \(6 \mathrm{mm}\) in diameter and is up to \(10 \mathrm{mm}\) in length. This vessel is best visualized in the anteroposterior projection with slight caudal angulation. The left main coronary artery bifurcates into the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the left circumflex (LCx) artery. In up to \(37\%\) of patients, however, the left main trifurcates into a third vessel known as the ramus intermedius, which lies between the LAD and the LCx. The right coronary artery is the dominant vessel in \(85\%\) of patients, supplying the posterior descending artery. The LCx artery is the dominant vessel \(15\%\) of the time. The interventricular septum is the most densely vascularized area of the heart. It is supplied by septal branches of the LAD that interconnect with septal branches from the posterior descending artery, producing a network of potential collateral channels. There are a number of congenital anomalies that can cause myocardial ischemia. Coronary artery fistulas (abnormal communications between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber or major vessel) comprise the most common congenital coronary abnormality that is of hemodynamic significance. Approximately half of the patients with such an anomaly are asymptomatic, but the remainder develop complications including heart failure, infective endocarditis, ischemia, or rupture of an aneurysm. The figure in this question demonstrates a congenital coronary fistula, arising from branches of the LAD and circumflex coronary arteries, that drains into the left ventricle (see right anterior oblique view in Fig. 1.16A and left anterior oblique view in Fig. 1.16B). Other congenital coronary anomalies that may result in myocardial ischemia include anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, congenital coronary stenosis, and anomalous origin of either coronary artery from the contralateral sinus of Valsalva.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 67  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 125-126)  

The clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome has historically depended on characteristic abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems. Genetic testing for mutations in the FBN1 gene has not been required for routine assessment. Since 1996, the Ghent criteria have been the standard for diagnosis and rely on "major" and "minor" manifestations. Major criteria include the following:  

Skeletal findings: At least four of the following: pectus carinatum, pectus excavatum requiring surgery, arm span/height ratio greater than 1.05, positive thumb sign (distal phalanx protrudes beyond clenched fist) and wrist sign (thumb and fifth finger overlap while encircling the wrist), scoliosis greater than 20 degrees or spondylolisthesis, reduced elbow extension less than 170 degrees, pes planus (flat feet), and protrusio acetabulae  

Cardiovascular findings: Dilation of sinuses of Valsalva and ascending aorta, or ascending aortic dissection  

Ocular finding: Ectopia lentis (lens dislocation identified by slit lamp examination)  

Central nervous system finding: Lumbosacral dural ectasia (identified by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging)  

Family or genetic history: First- degree relative who meets diagnostic criteria or who has known Marfan mutation  

Minor criteria include lesser skeletal abnormalities (joint hypermobility, nonsurgical pectus excavatum, high arched palate, and facial features such as malar hypoplasia), mitral valve prolapse, and dilation/dissection of the descending thoracic/abdominal aorta before age 50 years.  

In the absence of a family history, the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome requires one major manifestation in two organ systems, with involvement (major or minor criterion) in a third organ system; or, if a mutation known to cause Marfan syndrome is found, the diagnosis is based on one major criterion plus involvement (major or minor criterion) in a second organ system.  

In this patient's case, ectopia lentis is a major criterion, the other choices are minor criteria.  

In 2010, an international expert committee proposed revised diagnostic nosology for Marfan syndrome that emphasizes the importance of the cardiovascular manifestations of this condition. By the new criteria, in the absence of a family history of Marfan syndrome, the combination of aortic root dilatation and ectopic lentis is sufficient to establish the diagnosis. In the absence of either of these findings, the identification of a known FBN1 mutation or a combination of systemic findings is required for confirmation.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 68  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 230-232; Fig. 16.46; eFigs. 16.27 and 16.28)  

Assessment of the severity of regurgitant valvular lesions by Doppler echocardiography is less straightforward than assessment of stenotic conditions. Often a combination of findings must be visually integrated because no one criterion has sufficient accuracy for quantification. In aortic regurgitation (AR), findings that suggest marked elevation of left ventricular (LV) end- diastolic pressure are among the more predictive indicators of lesion severity. Unlike mitral regurgitation, in which the overall jet size correlates with the degree of regurgitation, the size and depth of penetration of the AR color Doppler signal are less strongly correlated with the magnitude of the lesion. This is in part due to merging of the color jet signals of AR with normal mitral inflow into the left ventricle. Measurements of the jet width may also be misleading because it may rapidly widen after passing through the more restricted valvular orifice, giving a falsely severe appearance. Careful imaging of the regurgitant signal in the parasternal short- axis view often gives the best sense of true jet width.  

In the presence of severe AR, there is rapid elevation of LV diastolic pressure, such that the velocity of retrograde flow into the left ventricle quickly decays, resulting in a shortened pressure half- time (PHT). A PHT of less than 250 milliseconds correlates with severe AR. In addition, the rapid rise of diastolic LV pressure can force the mitral valve to close prematurely. Such premature closure is often best visualized by M- mode imaging, in which the mitral leaflets coapt before the subsequent QRS complex appears.  

Although the depth of the Doppler signal in the left ventricle correlates poorly with the severity of AR, in advanced AR such flow typically extends past the tips of the papillary muscles and into the apex. Finally, detection of diastolic flow reversal in the descending thoracic aorta, imaged from the suprasternal notch, is a sign of moderate- to- severe regurgitation.  

Elevated LV outflow tract systolic gradients are a sign of systolic obstruction and do not provide direct information about the severity of AR.

Several pharmacologic stress- testing agents are available for patients who cannot exercise because of orthopedic limitations, neurologic conditions, or peripheral arterial disease. Dipyridamole acts by inhibiting the cellular uptake and intracellular breakdown of adenosine, increasing the concentration of the latter in the circulation. The subsequent increased activation of adenosine \(\mathrm{A}_{2\mathrm{a}}\) receptors results in vasodilatation and increased coronary blood flow in healthy coronary arteries. However, atherosclerotic vessels tend to be maximally dilated distal to the

<--- Page Split --->

site of significant stenosis at baseline, such that adenosine does not cause further dilatation in those territories. Therefore, perfusion imaging with dipyridamole, adenosine, or the selective \(\mathrm{A}_{2\mathrm{a}}\) agonist regadenoson in a patient with clinically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) reveals regions of relatively hypoperfused myocardium adjacent to normal zones of increased myocardial blood flow, with little change in myocardial oxygen demand. As a result, in a "positive" test, the infusion of the pharmacologic agent results in heterogeneity of myocardial perfusion but does not actually provoke myocardial ischemia in the majority of patients with CAD, unlike standard exercise stress testing. Ischemic ST- segment depression may occur in \(10\%\) to \(15\%\) of patients receiving these vasodilators and tends to correlate with the presence of multiple perfusion defects and extensive CAD. In contrast, chest pain without electrocardiographic changes is a common symptom after infusion of these agents, is likely due to stimulation of adenosine \(\mathrm{A}_{1}\) receptors, and is of no prognostic significance. Of note, xanthine derivatives (e.g., theophylline and caffeine) compete for adenosine receptors, and consumption of substances that contain these agents (e.g., coffee) before the test can result in a false- negative study.  

Dobutamine is an alternative pharmacologic agent when adenosine or dipyridamole should not be used, as in patients with bronchostatic pulmonary disease (because stimulation of the adenosine \(\mathrm{A}_{2\mathrm{b}}\) receptor can produce bronchospasm). Dobutamine increases myocardial oxygen demand by augmenting myocardial contractility, heart rate, and blood pressure. The increase in coronary blood flow is similar to that in physical exercise but less than that caused by dipyridamole or adenosine.  

In myocardial perfusion imaging, radiotracer agents such as technetium- 99m sestamibi or thallium- 201 should be injected 1 to 2 minutes before the end of exercise to allow accumulation of the radiotracer at a steady ischemic state.

## E (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 131, 137; Fig. 13.7; Table 13.6)  

In mitral stenosis (MS), the opening snap is an early diastolic sound generated when superior systolic bowing of the anterior mitral valve leaflet is rapidly reversed toward the left ventricle in early diastole, as a result of the high left atrial (LA) pressure. The presence of an opening snap implies a mobile body of the anterior mitral leaflet. The first heart sound tends to be quite loud in MS for a similar reason: it relates to the abrupt systolic movement of the body of the anterior mitral leaflet, which was recessed into the left ventricle throughout diastole because of the elevated LA pressure.  

The timing of the \(\mathrm{A}_{2\mathrm{o}}\) OS interval relates to the severity of MS. When MS is advanced and LA pressure is therefore high, LA and left ventricular pressures equilibrate earlier in diastole, resulting in a shorter \(\mathrm{A}_{2\mathrm{o}}\) OS interval. This interval does vary in atrial fibrillation according to the previous cycle length. During relatively short cycles, LA pressure is higher (because less atrial emptying can occur) and the \(\mathrm{A}_{2\mathrm{o}}\) OS interval lessens.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 14: p. 170; Fig. 14.44; Ch 64: pp. 1225-1226)  

A large number of arrhythmias may result from digitalis excess. These include bradyarrhythmias related to enhanced vagal tone (e.g., sinus bradycardia or arrest, or atrioventricular [AV] nodal blocks) and tachyarrhythmias attributed to delayed afterdepolarization- triggered activity (e.g., atrial, junctional, and ventricular tachycardia). One of the most common manifestations of excess digitalis is the appearance of ventricular premature beats (VPBs). However, because these are morphologically similar to VPBs of other causes, they are not highly specific for digitalis toxicity. When ventricular bigeminy occurs, varying morphology of the VPBs is suggestive of digitalis excess. Some forms of ventricular tachycardia are also more indicative of digitalis toxicity as the cause, including ventricular tachycardia with exit block and bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. Atrial tachycardia with block may be caused by excess digitalis but can also occur in the setting of structural heart disease without digitalis toxicity. The rhythm must be distinguished from atrial flutter, and because the amplitude of the atrial depolarization may be low, this rhythm is sometimes difficult to recognize. Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia is highly suggestive of digitalis excess, although other causes of this rhythm must be excluded, including myocardial ischemia, recent cardiac surgery, and myocarditis. The term nonparoxysmal refers to the gradual appearance and disappearance of the rhythm. The majority of patients with this arrhythmia demonstrate AV dissociation due to acceleration of the AV junctional pacemaker. AV dissociation that appears in the course of digitalis therapy should be considered a sign of digitalis intoxication until proven otherwise.

Among nuclear imaging techniques, flow and metabolism can be simultaneously assessed with positron emission tomography using rubidium- 82- or nitrogen- 13- labeled ammonia as a flow tracer and \(^{18}\mathrm{F}\) - fluorodeoxyglucose as a metabolic tracer. A mismatch pattern (preserved metabolic activity despite reduced flow), as in this case in the mid- left anterior descending artery distribution, is indicative of hibernating, viable myocardium. Conversely, a true

myocardial scar would demonstrate reduced flow and a matched reduction in metabolism. Additional modalities used to assess for viability include dobutamine echocardiography (which is more specific but less sensitive than radionuclide techniques) and delayed hyperenhancement assessed by gadolinium- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, which has excellent resolution and can accurately estimate the transmural extent of myocardial scar.  

Observational studies have suggested that patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and large areas of viable myocardium identified by noninvasive cardiac imaging have superior rates of survival, more substantial improvements in left ventricular function, a greater reduction in symptoms of heart failure, and better exercise tolerance after revascularization than patients with large areas of nonviable myocardium. However, the prospective, randomized STICH trial failed to show a difference in outcome with revascularization in patients with or without viable myocardium.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 13: p. 129-130, 131-132, 134; Figs. 13.4 and 13.7; Tables 13.6 and 13.7)  

Both aortic stenosis (AS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cause harsh systolic murmurs, but these conditions frequently can be differentiated by physical examination. For example, the carotid upstroke quality is different (see Braunwald, Ch 13: p. 129; Fig. 13.4). In AS, there is fixed outflow obstruction and the carotid upstrokes are diminished in amplitude and delayed (pulsus parvus et tardus). In contrast, the carotid upstroke in HCM is initially brisk, then diminishes in midlystole as the left ventricular (LV) outflow gradient becomes more pronounced. Another differentiating feature is the pattern of radiation of the murmur. In AS, the systolic murmur radiates to the carotid arteries, which is not the rule in HCM. If a systolic thrill is present, it is usually located in the second right intercostal space in AS, whereas it is more likely to be felt at the fourth left intercostal space in HCM. Dynamic bedside maneuvers are helpful to distinguish AS from HCM. Physiologic maneuvers that enhance contractility increase the intensity of both murmurs. Maneuvers that reduce LV filling (e.g., strain phase of Valsalva maneuver or standing from a squatting position) decrease the intensity of the AS murmur, but in HCM the decreased intraventricular volume causes LV dynamic outflow obstruction to intensify and the murmur of HCM becomes louder. The murmur of HCM diminishes in intensity with maneuvers that augment LV filling, such as sudden squatting from the standing position.

The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban are non- vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Each of these agents has been shown to be noninferior, or superior, to warfarin in efficacy and to produce less serious bleeding than warfarin. Additional advantages of these agents over warfarin include a fixed dosing regimen, no need to monitor laboratory tests to assess degree of anticoagulation, rapid onset of action such that bridging therapy with parenteral agents is not necessary, fewer drug interactions, and no important food interactions. Disadvantages compared with warfarin include higher cost and restricted use in patients with mechanical heart valves. Indeed, dabigatran resulted in more thromboembolic complications and greater bleeding risk compared with warfarin in the RE- ALIGN trial of patients with mechanical valves.   

The dose of each of these agents must be adjusted in patients with renal dysfunction. Despite its once- daily dosing in patients with atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban actually has a shorter half- life (5- 9 hours) than do apixaban or dabigatran (10- 16 hours), which are administered twice daily. All of these agents lose most of their anticoagulant effect after 24 hours of discontinuation, so they do not offer an advantage in patients with drug noncompliance.  

The antibody fragment idarucizumab binds dabigatran with high affinity, forming an essentially irreversible complex that is cleared through the kidneys. It rapid reverses the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran. Andexanet alpha is approved to reverse major bleeding in patients taking apixaban or rivaroxaban.

These single- photon emission computed tomographic images demonstrate transient ischemic dilatation of the left ventricle during stress. The size of the left ventricular (LV) cavity appears larger in the exercise images than in the rest images. This phenomenon is typically due to extensive exercise- induced ischemia with transient LV dysfunction and dilatation. In some patients, the appearance of LV chamber dilatation is actually due to the development of global subendocardial ischemia with reduced tracer uptake along the internal border of the left ventricle. As a result, there is the appearance of a larger chamber without true chamber dilatation. Regardless of the precise underlying mechanism, transient LV dilatation is a high- risk marker of severe ischemia and correlates with extensive coronary artery disease (CAD; i.e., multivessel or left main coronary artery) on angiography. Similarly, increased lung uptake is another

marker of extensive CAD and indicates increased risk for an adverse cardiac event.LV dilatation that is present both at rest and with exertion would be typical for dilated cardiomyopathy. Nuclear images of a patient with chest pain due to single- vessel disease of the left circumflex artery would likely demonstrate a reversible isolated perfusion defect at the lateral or posterior wall. For the patient with prior inferior myocardial infarction, a fixed inferior wall defect, with or without partial reversibility, would be expected. Breast attenuation artifact typically appears as a fixed defect of the anterior or anterolateral wall. A number of techniques have been developed to reduce the likelihood of a false- positive test due to breast attenuation artifact, including the use of technetium- 99m- based agents and electrocardiographic gating.

Pulsus alternans (Fig. 1.71) is a sign of marked left ventricular dysfunction characterized by alternating strong and weak ventricular contractions, which results in alternating intensity of the peripheral pulses. It is thought to reflect cyclic changes in intracellular calcium levels and action potential duration. It is more easily detectable in the femoral than in the brachial, radial, or carotid artery and can be observed with sphygmomanometry by slowly deflating the blood pressure cuff below the systolic level. When present, this sign can be enhanced with maneuvers that decrease venous return, such as assumption of erect posture. Because patients with pulsus alternans generally have markedly reduced ventricular contractile function, an \(\mathrm{S}_3\) gallop sound is common. Pulsus alternans would only rarely be accompanied by electrical alternans of the QRS complex on the ECG. The latter is more likely to be found in patients with large pericardial effusions.

Exercise testing is often helpful in the assessment of patients with known or suspected arrhythmias. In select patients, particularly those with exercise- induced palpitations, exercise testing is a crucial component of the evaluation. In others, exercise testing can be an important adjunct to ambulatory monitoring and invasive electrophysiologic testing. In association with exercise testing, ventricular arrhythmias may occur during the recovery period, in part because circulating catecholamines continue to increase for several minutes after exertion. In fact, frequent ventricular ectopy in the early postexercise phase predicts a worse long- term cardiac prognosis than ectopy that occurs only during exercise. Supraventricular tachycardia during exercise testing occurs in \(4\%\) to \(10\%\) of normal individuals and in up to \(40\%\) of patients with underlying heart disease. Sustained supraventricular tachycardia develops in only \(1\%\) to \(2\%\) of patients and is not diagnostic for underlying ischemic heart disease. Patients with known preexcitation, such as Wolff- Parkinson- White (WPW) syndrome, only rarely experience tachyarrhythmias during exercise testing, because antegrade conduction through the atrioventricular node is favored by the catecholamine response to exercise. As such, the delta wave disappears during exercise in \(20\%\) to \(50\%\) of patients with WPW syndrome.  

Exercise testing is also useful to assess the response and risks of antiarrhythmic drug therapy. This is particularly important for patients on class IC antiarrhythmic agents, such as propafenone and flecainide, because QRS widening during exercise on such drugs is predictive of a proarrhythmic effect and reentrant ventricular tachycardia. In addition, prolongation of the QT interval of greater than 10 milliseconds during exercise identifies patients at

particularly high risk of a proarrhythmic effect on class IA antiarrhythmic agents.  

The development of left bundle branch block (LBBB) during exercise is predictive of subsequent progression to permanent LBBB. Patients with exercise- induced LBBB also have a threefold increase in the risk of death or major cardiac events compared with patients without this abnormality.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 13: pp. 131, 134; Fig. 13.6; Tables 13.6 and 13.7)  

Ejection sounds are high- frequency "clicks" that occur in early systole. They may be either aortic or pulmonic in origin, require a mobile valve for their generation, and begin at the exact time of maximal opening of the semilunar valve in question. If the valve is structurally abnormal, the ejection sound is believed to be caused by the abrupt halting of valve opening at its maximum level of ascent in early systole. If the sound is associated with a structurally normal valve, it is called a "vascular" ejection sound (e.g., associated with a dilated aortic root. In valvular pulmonic stenosis, the ejection sound is loudest during expiration. With inspiration, increased venous return augments atrial systole and results in partial opening of the pulmonic valve before ventricular systole commences. In contrast, with expiration, the pulmonic valve is forced to open from a fully closed position, thus generating a louder ejection sound as the valve's systolic movement is suddenly halted. Aortic ejection sounds do not vary with respiration.  

The click of mitral valve prolapse occurs in mid- or late systole and coincides with maximal systolic excursion of the prolapsed leaflet(s) into the left atrium. The generation of the click has been attributed to sudden tensing of the redundant leaflets and elongated chordae tendineae. Maneuvers that decrease left ventricular volume, such as the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver or standing from a squatting position, move the click earlier in systole (Fig. 1.72).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes several electrocardiographic abnormalities related to changes of the position of the heart in the chest and hyperinflation of the lungs. These include reduced amplitude of the QRS complex, right- axis deviation, and delayed transition in the precordial leads, which may be sufficiently prominent to simulate anterior myocardial infarction (see Braunwald, Ch 14: p. 155; Fig. 14.18).  

For right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) to be evident on the ECG, it must be severe enough to overcome the opposing effects of the larger left ventricular forces. In patients with COPD, additional electrocardiographic abnormalities that support the presence of true RVH include (1) marked right- axis deviation (>110 degrees); (2) deep S waves in the lateral precordial leads; and (3) an \(\mathrm{S_1Q_3T_3}\) pattern (S wave in lead I, prominent Q in lead III, inverted T waves in the inferior leads).

## E (Braunwald, Ch 22: pp. 403-404; see also Answer to Question 41)  

Detection and quantification of shunts within the cardiac chambers or great vessels can be accomplished by cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and radionuclide scintigraphy. Shunt evaluation by cardiac catheterization involves utilizing oximetry in multiple locations and calculation of pulmonary and systemic blood flow. Comparison of pulmonary and systemic blood flows helps to establish the presence and magnitude of the shunt, whereas oximetry in multiple locations helps to localize the site of abnormal flow. "Physiologic" shunting, such as occurs in hypoventilation, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock, should be correctable with the administration of \(100\%\) oxygen. Failure to correct with \(100\%\) oxygen suggests an "anatomic" shunt.  

A shortcoming of oximetric shunt detection is its lack of sensitivity, although most clinically relevant shunts can be detected using this method. When performing an oximetry run, multiple sites in the inferior vena cava (IVC), superior

<--- Page Split --->

vena cava (SVC), and right atrium must be sampled because the oxygen saturation from these sites may vary widely. The IVC, because of the relatively low renal oxygen consumption, usually has the highest oxygen saturation. Conversely, the coronary sinus delivers venous blood with a very low oxygen saturation. The Flamm formula is used to estimate the mixed venous oxygen content \((\mathrm{Mvo}_2)\) proximal to a leftto- right shunt at the right atrial level:  

\[\mathrm{Mvo}_2 = \frac{3(\mathrm{SVC}\mathrm{O}_2\mathrm{content}) + 1(\mathrm{IVC}\mathrm{O}_2\mathrm{content})}{4}\]

The normal QRS complex in lead \(\mathrm{V}_1\) consists of a small R wave, representing initial septal depolarization, followed by an S wave, which is inscribed as the bulk of electrical forces swing in the direction of the left ventricle.  

In right ventricular hypertrophy, the increased rightsided forces cause abnormally tall R waves in leads \(\mathrm{V}_1\) and \(\mathrm{V}_2\) , deep S waves in the lateral precordial leads, and right- axis deviation. The Wolff- Parkinson- White (WPW) syndrome, a form of preexcitation, is characterized by a short PR interval and an initial slur (delta wave) with prolongation of the QRS complex. When WPW is caused by a posterior or lateral left ventricular (LV) accessory pathway, the delta wave is positive in lead \(\mathrm{V}_1\) , associated with prominence of the R wave. A tall R wave in the right precordial leads is also typical of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In that disorder, myocardial dystrophy of the posterobasal and contiguous lateral LV wall results in deep Q waves in leads I, aVL, and \(\mathrm{V}_5\) and \(\mathrm{V}_6\) , with reciprocal changes (tall R waves) in leads \(\mathrm{V}_1\) and \(\mathrm{V}_2\) . Accidental placement of the right precordial leads too low on the chest wall is a common technical error that results in prominent R waves in leads \(\mathrm{V}_1\) and \(\mathrm{V}_2\) .  

In left anterior fascicular block, the amplitude of the R waves in the right precordial leads is often diminished, and deep S waves are present in leads \(\mathrm{V}_5\) and \(\mathrm{V}_6\) because of the anterosuperiorly directed late QRS forces.

The hemodynamic pressure tracing is consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM). In the tracing, a large gradient exists between the midcavity of the left ventricle and the aorta as shown during the first three full beats. As the catheter is withdrawn into the subaortic left ventricular (LV) outflow tract, the gradient is no longer observed (last three beats). In patients with valvular aortic stenosis (AS), the pressure gradient would persist in the latter location.  

A bifid aortic pulse contour is demonstrated in the tracing, with a notch on the upstroke ("spike- and- dome" configuration) characteristic of HCM. This is in contrast to delayed rise of the aortic pressure tracing (and therefore carotid artery pulsation) expected in patients with valvular AS. In addition, LV diastolic dysfunction is common in HCM, owing to impaired LV compliance, which leads to a prominent LV a wave and elevation of end- diastolic pressure, as shown on the tracing ( \(\sim 20 \mathrm{mm}\) Hg in this example).   

There is no role for aortic valve replacement in the treatment of HCM. In selected patients with HCM and severe symptomatic obstruction due to septal hypertrophy, surgical myomectomy or alcohol septal ablation may be beneficial.

Therapy with anthracycline- based chemotherapy regimens is associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Guidelines currently recommend a left ventricular ejection fraction- based approach for surveillance during and after therapy. The Strain Surveillance of Chemotherapy for Improving Cardiovascular Outcomes (SUCCOUR) trial randomized 331 anthracycline- treated patients with another heart failure risk factor to cardioprotective therapy initiation guided by either a \(12\%\) or more relative reduction in global longitudinal strain \((n = 166)\) or more than \(10\%\) absolute reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction \((n = 165)\) . Patients were then monitored over time to assess for changes in left ventricular ejection (LVEF). At 1 year of follow- up, the primary outcome of change in LVEF was not significantly different between the two arms. However, there was significantly greater use of cardioprotective therapy, and fewer patients met cancer therapy- related cardiac dysfunction criteria, in the global longitudinal strain- guided arm than in the left ventricular ejection fraction- guided arm \((5.8\%\) vs. \(13.7\%\) ; \(P = .02\) ). The investigators concluded that further studies are needed to determine whether a global longitudinal strain- guided approach to cardioprotective therapy reduces the long- term risk of heart failure and improves clinical outcomes in patients treats with anthracycline- based therapy.  

Though this patient's LVEF remained stabled after anthracycline therapy, her average global longitudinal strain decreased by \(21\%\) . Therefore, initiating cardioprotective therapy would be reasonable. A beta blocker and/or angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) would be options for such therapy, but an ACE inhibitor or ARB would be a better choice for this patient with baseline bradycardia.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 22: pp. 398-399)  

The pioneering work of Gorlin and Gorlin provided equations to calculate cardiac valve areas based on the

<--- Page Split --->

measured transvalvular pressure gradient and blood flow. The valve area is proportional to  

\[\frac{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{K}\times\sqrt{\Delta\mathrm{P}}}\]  

in which F represents flow across the valve, \(\Delta \mathrm{P}\) is the mean pressure gradient across the orifice, and K is an empiric constant for the valve in question. In the calculation of mitral valve area, a confirmed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is typically substituted for the left atrial pressure.  

There are assumptions and potential pitfalls in the determination of valve area by catheterization techniques. Because flow in the Gorlin equation is assumed to be systemic (forward) cardiac output, the presence of regurgitation across the valve in question results in a falsely low value for F in the Gorlin equation, and therefore the calculated valve area may be underestimated. In such cases, the calculated valve area represents the lower limit of the true valve area.  

Accurate and simultaneous determinations of cardiac output and mean pressure gradient are essential in the determination of a stenotic orifice area. Both of these measurements are subject to error. Because it is the square root of the mean pressure gradient that is used in the Gorlin formula, errors in measurement of the cardiac output have a proportionately greater influence on the calculated valve area.

Exercise testing is the preferred stress modality to evaluate for coronary artery disease because it allows a correlation between exertional symptoms and objective findings of ischemia and provides substantial prognostic information. However, many patients are not capable of attaining a sufficient level of exercise (because of physical limitations or poor conditioning) and undergo pharmacologic stress testing instead. The most widely used agents for pharmacologic stress testing are (1) coronary arteriolar vasodilators (regadenoson, adenosine, and dipyridamole) and (2) adrenergic agents such as dobutamine. During pharmacologic perfusion positron emission tomographic scintigraphy of a normal individual, there is homogeneous uptake of the radiotracer (e.g., rubidium- 82) throughout the myocardium in both the exercise and resting states. The images in the case of this patient demonstrate severe vasodilator- induced ischemia (hypoperfusion) of the anterior and anteroseptal walls. That is, there is a large region of hypoperfusion on the stress images that is predominantly reversible: it almost completely fills in on the resting images. A fixed defect is one that is present and unchanged on both exercise and rest images and corresponds to a region of prior myocardial infarction or scar. This patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization. A \(90\%\) stenosis at the anastomosis of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery was found, and successful percutaneous intervention was performed.

This patient has an advanced form of hemochromatosis, a disease that leads to abnormal deposition of iron in tissues. The most common form of hemochromatosis is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder due to a mutation in the HFE gene that codes for a transmembrane protein responsible for regulating iron uptake in the intestine and liver. Acquired hemochromatosis is the result of excess iron load due to an underlying disease process (e.g., thalassemia) or increased ingestion of iron.  

Normal body content of iron is maintained by the regulated absorption of iron in the intestines. In inherited hemochromatosis, mucosal absorption is inappropriately high, which leads to elevated plasma iron levels and increased transferrin saturation. The extra iron load is deposited in multiple organs, including the heart, pancreas, and liver. A classic presentation therefore is that of "bronze diabetes" due to excess iron deposition in the dermis and pancreas. Other findings include hypogonadism (impaired hypothalamic- pituitary function), arthropathy (often the small joints of the hands), and cirrhosis. The severity of cardiac involvement in hemochromatosis varies widely and may culminate in heart failure due to a mixed dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Electrocardiographic findings may include supraventricular arrhythmias, varying degrees of atrioventricular block, and low QRS voltage. Diagnosis is based on the history, an elevated plasma iron level, normal or low total iron- binding capacity (TIBC), and markedly increased transferrin saturation (iron:TIBC ratio) and serum ferritin levels. Treatment options include phlebotomy and chelating agents (e.g., desferrioxamine).

Physiologic maneuvers that alter left ventricular (LV) filling can aid in the bedside diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Any maneuver that reduces LV volume, such as the Valsalva maneuver or standing from a supine position, causes the valve to prolapse into the left atrium sooner, such that the click and onset of the murmur occur earlier in systole and the murmur may become louder. Conversely, actions that augment impedance to LV emptying, such as isometric handgrip, increase the LV volume and thus delay the click and murmur. Squatting from a standing position will also delay the click and murmur due to the increased venous return and augmented LV volume.  

Carotid sinus massage is not generally helpful in differentiating the murmur of MVP from other valvular abnormalities. This maneuver can be useful to slow the heart rate in a tachycardia patient to help characterize extra heart sounds.

## E (Braunwald, Ch 14: p. 171; Fig. 14.46; see also Answer to Question 19)  

Hyperkalemia is associated with a distinctive sequence of electrocardiographic abnormalities, beginning with narrowing and peaking (tenting) of the T wave, with a shortened QT interval. Progressive hyperkalemia reduces atrial and ventricular resting membrane potentials, which inactivates sodium channels and decreases conduction velocity. At that stage, the QRS complex begins to widen and the P wave amplitude decreases. Complete loss of observed P waves may occur. In that situation, sinus rhythm typically persists but the P wave amplitude is so small that it is not recorded on the surface ECG. Very marked hyperkalemia leads to asystole, sometimes preceded by a slow undulatory (sinusoidal wave) pattern on the ECG caused by marked QRS widening.  

Hypokalemia, in contrast, is associated with hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and increased action potential duration. This results in resting ST- segment depression and QT interval prolongation. The T waves often become flat, whereas U waves become prominent. The QT prolongation predisposes to torsades de pointes. Hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia, predisposes to digitalis- associated tachyarrhythmias.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 89  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 14: pp. 166-168, 171; Fig. 14.46; Table 14.10)  

Noninfarction Q waves can be produced by conditions that result in (1) abnormal heart position, (2) altered ventricular conduction, (3) ventricular enlargement, or (4) myocardial damage or replacement. Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome is an example of altered ventricular conduction, in which early activation of the inferoposterior wall by a bypass tract may result in inferior Q waves and a pseudoinfarction pattern. Similarly, left bundle branch block (not right bundle branch block) is frequently associated with noninfarction Q waves due to altered ventricular activation. Any condition that displaces the mass of the left ventricle posteriorly, such as cardiomyopathy with ventricular dilatation, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is associated with Q waves in the right- sided chest leads and poor R wave progression across the precordium. Incorrect superior placement of the right precordial chest leads can also result in the appearance of Q waves in those leads.  

Acidosis leads to hyperkalemia with the characteristic changes of that condition (see Answer to Question 88), but not to the development of Q waves.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 90  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 15: p. 182; Fig. 15.3)  

Several abnormalities on the baseline ECG limit the interpretation of standard exercise electrocardiography. These patterns include preexcitation syndromes, paced ventricular rhythms, left ventricular hypertrophy, and left bundle branch block. Digoxin can accentuate ischemic exercise- induced ST- segment changes, even if the resting ECG is without evidence of ST- segment depression.   

Right bundle branch block (RBBB) is associated with T wave and ST- segment changes in the anterior precordial leads. Exercise- induced ST- segment depression in these leads \((\mathrm{V}_1 - \mathrm{V}_4)\) is a common finding in patients with RBBB and is nondiagnostic for ischemia. Thus, RBBB decreases the sensitivity of the test; however, the ST segments in leads \(\mathrm{V}_5\) and \(\mathrm{V}_6\) and in leads II and aVF remain interpretable in patients with this conduction disorder.  

ST- segment depressions typically are not predictive of the anatomic site of ischemia. In contrast, ST- segment elevations in leads that do not contain pathologic Q waves are specific for exercise- induced ischemia and are predictive of the anatomic location of ischemia.  

Certain findings on exercise electrocardiography are indicative of severe (left main or multivesel) coronary artery disease and should be considered "high risk" markers. These include \(\geq 2\) - mm ST- segment depressions (particularly at low levels of exercise), ST- segment depressions in more than five leads, ST- segment depressions that persist more than 5 minutes during the recovery phase, ST- segment elevations, and hypotension during exercise (see Answer to Question 48).

The continuous- wave Doppler profile demonstrates combined mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation (MR). In the figure, diastolic flow toward the transducer (into the left ventricle) is represented by velocities above the baseline while flow away from the transducer (into the left atrium [LA]) is indicated by velocities below the baseline. In a normal individual, there would be no flow across the valve during systole, and the peak diastolic velocity would be less than \(1.3\mathrm{m / second}\) . The presence of MS results in a high diastolic velocity (usually \(>1.5\mathrm{m / second}\) ). In addition, the persistent diastolic pressure gradient between the LA and left ventricle in patients with MS results in an abnormally delayed decline of the transmital velocity signal, as shown in this case. The severity of MS can be determined from Doppler measurements by calculating the pressure decline half- time (see Answer to Question 26).  

Two- dimensional echocardiography and Doppler interrogation are also very useful techniques for assessing MR and determining its cause. The continuous- wave Doppler examination shown here demonstrates abnormal systolic flow directed retrograde into the LA. Doppler color flow imaging (not shown in this example) estimates the magnitude of MR, which can be estimated by the area of the visualized regurgitant jet. When MR is severe, Doppler interrogation demonstrates reversal of systolic flow in the pulmonary veins. MR jets that are eccentrically directed along the left atrial wall, rather than centrally located, may underestimate the severity of MR as determined by Doppler techniques (Coanda effect).

D (Braunwald, Ch 6: pp. 63- 64)Quality improvement initiatives are increasingly used in healthcare settings, employing several approaches. A commonly used model is PDSA (Plan- Do- Study- Act), in which goals, metrics, and changes to implement are set and then tested in an iterative PDSA cycle. This model works best with goals that are measurable, allowing quantification of the effects of a given iteration. The Lean approach was developed at Toyota as a means to improve the efficiency of automobile production. Lean is focused on reducing wasteful processes (including overproduction, unnecessary motion, and uneven production). In healthcare, this approach relies on mapping the essential components of complex processes and empowering all team members to identify targets and areas of potential waste. Whereas Lean focuses on eliminating waste, Six Sigma focuses on reducing unnecessary variation in care delivery and reducing error rates to less than six standard deviations below average. Six Sigma's iterative process (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) is a variation on the PDSA theme, adding the "control" element to underscore the need for continued monitoring of care processes after successfully reducing variability.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 54: pp.1062-1063,1063; Fig.54.1; Table 54.2)  

The microscopic specimen demonstrates marked myocyte disarray typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a genetic disorder caused by more than 900 mutations in genes that encode sarcomeric proteins. It is transmitted in an autosomal- dominant fashion, and specific mutations are often unique to affected families. More than \(50\%\) of all HCM mutations occur in genes that encode \(\beta\) - myosin heavy chain or cardiac myosin- binding protein C.  

The risk of most concern for patients with HCM is sudden cardiac death. It results from ventricular tachycardia/ fibrillation and may occur at any age but is most often a complication in adolescents and young adults with HCM. The risk is greatest in those with specific clinical markers, for whom primary prevention with an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator is often appropriate, particularly in younger patients: (1) a family history of HCM- related death, especially if sudden; (2) unexplained syncope; (3) hypotensive or attenuated blood pressure response on exercise testing; (4) multiple, prolonged nonsustained bursts of ventricular tachycardia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring; and (5) marked left ventricular hypertrophy (wall thickness \(\geq 30 \mathrm{mm}\) ).

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 94  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 52: p.1039; eFigs.52.2-52.4; Fig.52.9; eTable 52.2)  

This patient has a form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a condition in which fibrofatty replacement of myocardium, most commonly of the right ventricle, leads to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. ARVC results from mutations in genes that encode components of cardiac desmosomes, cell membrane structures that maintain structural and functional contacts between neighboring myocytes. ARVC can occur as an isolated cardiomyopathy or as a syndromic disorder. In Naxos syndrome ARVC is accompanied by woolly, kinky hair and palmar- plantar keratosis. It arises from autosomal recessive mutations (in distinction to isolated ARVC, which is transmitted in an autosomal- dominant fashion) in the gene that encodes plakoglobin, a cytoplasmic desmosomal protein. Patients with Carvajal syndrome display similar hair and skin findings, but the cardiomyopathy findings predominantly affect the left ventricle. The patient in this question has predominantly right ventricular involvement and therefore has Naxos syndrome.  

Major diagnostic criteria for ARVC include (1) right ventricular (RV) enlargement and dysfunction visualized by echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography; (2) fibrofatty replacement of myocardium on endomyocardial biopsy (however, there is a high false- negative rate of diagnosis because of sampling error and because the RV septum [the region sampled by the bioptome] may not display characteristic changes); (3) electrocardiographic abnormalities, including inverted T waves in \(\mathrm{V}_1\) to \(\mathrm{V}_3\) , an epsilon wave between the QRS complex and the T wave in leads \(\mathrm{V}_1\) to \(\mathrm{V}_3\) , late potentials on signal averaged electrocardiography, nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia with left bundle branch morphology, and superior axis; and (4) a confirmed family history of ARVC in a first- degree relative.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 95  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 16: p.222; Ch 53: pp.1055-1056; Fig.53.2; Table 53.2)  

The presented clinical scenario is most consistent with cardiac amyloidosis, an infiltrative cardiomyopathy in which amyloid fibrils (in this case, abnormal amyloid light- chains [AL] associated with multiple myeloma) expand the extracellular space of cardiac tissues. Clinical manifestations include progressive heart failure (often right- sided > left- sided), postural hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction, macroglossia, and periorbital purpura (in AL amyloidosis). This patient's electrocardiogram shows reduced limb lead voltage due to myocardial infiltration of amyloid fibrils.

The echocardiogram in cardiac amyloidosis typically demonstrates increased thickness of both ventricles with a bright appearance of the myocardium, diffusely thickened valves, and biatrial enlargement. Diastolic dysfunction is common, as manifest by tissue Doppler imaging, with reduced early diastolic E' velocities at both the lateral and medial mitral annular levels (note that medial > lateral mitral annular E' ["annulus reversus"] in answer choice C is characteristic of constrictive pericarditis, not amyloidosis) (see Braunwald, Ch 16: pp. 242- 243).  

Although the LV ejection fraction may appear normal in patients with symptomatic cardiac amyloidosis, systolic dysfunction is often present by strain imaging (speckle- tracking), which characteristically reveals severely reduced longitudinal strain at the LV base, but preserved apical strain (Fig. 1.73).  

While pericardial effusion is a common finding in cardiac amyloidosis, it is rarely large.
