## ANSWER TO QUESTION 436  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 52: p. 1042)  

This woman presents with features of an acute coronary syndrome, but coronary angiography demonstrates no significant coronary disease. Rather, left ventricular (LV) angiography demonstrates a large region of apical akinesis and preserved contraction at the base. These features are consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also termed stress- induced cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning syndrome). This is a reversible condition that mimics acute myocardial infarction and occurs primarily in postmenopausal women, usually precipitated by a profound emotional or physical event. Regional contractile abnormalities are typical, usually causing apical akinesis with compensatory hypercontractility at the base. However, in some affected patients the akinetic or dyskinetic segment is located at the midventricle or base instead.  

This syndrome is usually transient, with rapid contractile recovery within days to weeks. However, early complications occur rarely, including malignant arrhythmias, thromboembolism, LV rupture, and cardiogenic shock, such that acute in- hospital mortality is \(1.2\%\) . The mechanism by which takotsubo cardiomyopathy arises is speculative; it may be a response to a catecholamine surge resulting in regional microvascular dysfunction in susceptible patients. Recurrences occur in less than \(5\%\) of patients. Anticoagulation is not routinely recommended, despite the frequently present apical wall motion abnormality (unless thrombus is visualized) because of the usually rapid resolution of the disorder.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 86: p. 1616-1617)  

The ECG demonstrates diffuse ST- segment elevations and PR- segment depressions that are most consistent with acute pericarditis.1 ST- segment elevations in all leads except aVR develop in the majority of patients with acute pericarditis, and PR- segment depression is found in up to \(80\%\)   

Although chest pain is the most common symptom in acute pericarditis, its location and quality are variable. The pain is often positional in that it improves by sitting upright or leaning forward and is aggravated with coughing, inspiring deeply, or lying supine. Fever is common, but the cardinal physical finding is a pericardial friction rub. The three components of the complete pericardial rub correspond to atrial systole, ventricular systole, and the early filling phase of ventricular diastole.  

Cardiac serum biomarkers can be elevated in acute pericarditis because of inflammation of the adjacent myocardium. As a result, an initial determination of markers such as cardiac troponin I cannot reliably differentiate between acute pericarditis and myocardial infarction.2  

Fibrinolytic therapy is of potential harm if administered to a patient with acute pericarditis because hemorrhagic tamponade could follow. Initial therapy for patients with acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis should include aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Randomized prospective clinical trials show that colchicine reduces the duration of acute symptomatology and recurrences of pericarditis.3 For truly refractory symptoms, glucocorticoids may be beneficial, but should not be prescribed as initial therapy, as such use is associated with increased recurrence rates of pericarditis. Nitrates have no role in the management of pericardial symptoms.

Localized coarctation of the aorta consists of a shelf in the posterolateral aortic wall opposite the ductus arteriosus. It is more common in males, and there is a high degree of association with bicuspid aortic valve and Turner syndrome. Other associated congenital cardiac malformations include patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal

defect, and mitral valve abnormalities. Young patients with coarctation are usually asymptomatic. In older children or adults, symptoms may include headache, leg fatigue, and intermittent claudication. Patients may also come to medical attention because of symptoms associated with left ventricular failure, infective endarteritis, or aortic rupture or dissection.  

Simultaneous palpation of the upper and lower extremities in patients with coarctation often reveals diminished and delayed femoral pulses compared with the radial pulse. Exercise typically accentuates this finding. A midsystolic murmur over the chest and back is often present. In addition, auscultation may demonstrate the ejection click and systolic murmur of a coexistent bicuspid aortic valve.  

Persistent systemic hypertension after repair of the coarctation occurs in up to one- third of patients, even in the absence of recoarctation. Risk factors include older age at repair and higher blood pressure at the time of repair.1,2

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 439  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 72: p. 1399)  

The Doppler recording displays a symmetric systolic profile with an elevated transaortic valve systolic velocity of \(4\mathrm{m / second}\) , which corresponds to a peak instantaneous systolic gradient of \(64\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) (from the simplified Bernoulli equation: pressure gradient \(= 4\times\) velocity). Thus, this patient presents with symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). Angina pectoris, syncope, and heart failure are the cardinal symptoms of this condition. The onset of symptoms in patients with AS is an ominous sign: natural history survival trends show that the time of death following symptom occurrence is approximately 5 years for patients with angina, 3 years for those with syncope, and 2 years for patients with heart failure. Angina is present in approximately two- thirds of patients with critical AS. It arises in the absence of significant coronary artery obstruction in up to half of patients, owing to both increased oxygen demand and impaired coronary vasodilatory reserve with microcirculatory dysfunction. Whereas the most common early symptom in patients with AS is a decrease in exercise tolerance or dyspnea on exertion (due to reduced left ventricular compliance or the limited ability to increase cardiac output with exercise), symptoms of advanced heart failure (orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pulmonary edema) occur late in the course.  

Syncope in AS typically occurs with exertion and is due to systemic vasodilatation with reduced vascular tone in the setting of a fixed cardiac output.  

An association between calcific aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, particularly due to angiodysplasia, has been observed (termed Heyde syndrome). Associated bleeding is thought to arise because of shear stress- induced platelet aggregation by the stenotic valve with reduction of high- molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor and an increased number of proteolytic fragments. This abnormality is correctable by aortic valve replacement.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 440  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 84: p. 1596)  

Cocaine is the most commonly used illicit drug among patients presenting to emergency departments, and associated cardiovascular consequences include ischemia and infarction, myocardial diastolic and/or systolic dysfunction, and arrhythmias. The mechanisms of myocardial ischemia and infarction include (1) increased myocardial oxygen demand in the setting of limited oxygen supply, (2) intense coronary arterial vasoconstriction, and/or (3) enhanced platelet aggregation and thrombogenicity. In addition, the vascular injury caused by cocaine may lead to increased endothelial permeability and accelerated atherogenesis. Cocaine use increases the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) 24- fold over the following 60 minutes in individuals otherwise at low risk for MI. Notably, the occurrence of myocardial infarction after cocaine is not associated with the amount ingested, route of administration, or frequency of use.  

Mechanisms of myocardial dysfunction after long- term cocaine use include (1) myocardial ischemia or infarction, (2) cardiomyopathy due to repeated sympathetic stimulation, and (3) altered myocardial and endothelial cytokine production. Myocardial dysfunction can also occur acutely after cocaine use, likely reflecting drug- associated metabolic disturbances or direct toxic effects of the drug.

The common anatomic types of atrial septal defect (ASD) include the sinus venosus or "high" ASD, the ostium secundum ASD, and the ostium primum ASD. The sinus venosus defect is often accompanied by anomalous pulmonary venous return. The ostium secundum type of ASD, which appears in the midinteratrial septum, should be distinguished from patent foramen ovale, which occurs in up to \(25\%\) of adults. Ostium primum ASDs are a type of atrioventricular septal defect, discussed in a subsequent question.  

Patients with ASDs are usually asymptomatic in early life, and only rare children with this disorder experience

<--- Page Split --->

exertional dyspnea and easy fatigability. Atrial arrhythmias are uncommon. Children with ASDs do tend to be underdeveloped physically and prone to respiratory tract infections. The diagnosis of ASD in the young is most often prompted by detection of a heart murmur on routine physical examination. In adults, the most common manifesting symptoms are exercise intolerance and palpitations.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 442  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 82: p. 1543)  

In patients with congenital heart disease the ECG is important to evaluate for right- axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy, and rhythm and conduction disturbances. For example, right ventricular hypertrophy may be a sign of pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or other disorders causing right- sided pressure or volume overload, including septal defects.  

Atrial arrhythmias commonly accompany congenital heart disease. Atrial flutter is much more frequent in young patients than atrial fibrillation. It often arises in patients with a history of surgical repair and can be challenging to treat. Pharmacologic agents are generally ineffective, and catheter ablation is usually necessary; recurrence is common. Conduction disturbances, such as first- degree atrioventricular (AV) block, are often evident in patients with AV septal defects, congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, and Ebstein anomaly.  

The electrocardiographic findings of myocardial infarction in an infant suggest the presence of an anomalous origin of a coronary artery. Left ventricular volume overload due to aortic or mitral regurgitation can result in deep Q waves in the left precordial leads.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 443  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 82: p. 1558)  

Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) may be classified by their locations and margins. Muscular VSDs are bordered entirely by myocardium and may be found in the trabecular septum, inlet septum, or outlet septum. Membranous VSDs are bordered in part by fibrous continuity between an atrioventricular valve and an arterial valve. Doubly committed subarterial VSDs, which are more common in Asian and South American patients, are situated in the outlet septum and bordered by fibrous continuity of the aortic and pulmonary valves.  

The size of a VSD relates to the consequent pathophysiology and potential complications. A restrictive VSD is  

small \((Q_{p} / Q_{s}< 1.4)\) and produces a significant pressure gradient between the left and right ventricles. It typically does not cause hemodynamic impairment and may eventually spontaneously close, but the turbulence of the high- pressure jet across the defect presents a high risk of endocarditis. Because of the high gradient, infants with a restrictive VSD demonstrate a loud murmur and often present at an early age. Conversely, infants with large nonrestrictive defects present at a later age because the equalization of pressures across the defect attenuates the systolic murmur. A large, nonrestrictive VSD \((Q_{p} / Q_{s} > 2.2)\) is accompanied by a substantial left- to- right shunt, with subsequent development of an elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Such patients may eventually develop left ventricular volume overload, heart failure, and Eisenmenger syndrome (related to the progressive rise in pulmonary artery pressure). Closure of the defect, either surgically or by transcatheter device placement, is the treatment of choice for those with a significant VSD in the absence of contraindications (e.g., irreversible pulmonary hypertension). After repair, the ECG is usually notable for right bundle branch block.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 444  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 82: p. 1557)  

Although atrial septal defects (ASDs) are frequently asymptomatic, children may experience exertional dyspnea or frequent chest infections. Physical examination usually demonstrates wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound. Other common findings include a systolic murmur of increased flow across the pulmonic valve or a mid- diastolic rumble due to increased flow through the tricuspid valve. The ECG may be helpful in distinguishing the type of ASD. Secundum ASD patients often exhibit right- axis deviation on the ECG, whereas those with primum ASD characteristically exhibit left- axis deviation. Patients with sinus venosus ASDs exhibit left- axis deviation of the P wave.  

ASD repair is advised for patients with a \(Q_{p} / Q_{s}\) of 1.5 or more, particularly if the anatomy is suitable for percutaneous transcatheter device closure. Repair improves New York Heart Association functional class in symptomatic patients. For adults who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, device closure improves exercise capacity. In patients who undergo successful repair of an isolated secundum defect (by surgery or by transcatheter device), lifelong endocarditis prophylaxis is not required. Prophylaxis is appropriate for the first 6 months after device closure, while the device endotheliacities.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 445  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 98: p.1830)  

The echocardiogram demonstrates a pedunculated mass in the right atrium that is most suggestive of an atrial myxoma. Features that suggest myxoma include (1) attachment of the mass to the interatrial septum (the most common site of attachment is in the region of the fossa ovalis) and (2) a mass that is pedunculated and heterogeneous in appearance. Other cardiac tumors, including lipomas and rhabdomyomas, would be within the differential diagnosis. However, these other tumors are rarely pedunculated and more often infiltrate into the myocardium itself. The echocardiographic appearance would also prompt consideration of an intracardiac thrombus. However, atrial thrombi tend to be located in the posterior portion of the atrium and have more of a layered appearance than the heterogeneous mottling apparent in this example.  

Atrial myxoma is the most common primary tumor of the heart, and more than \(80\%\) of such tumors arise in the left atrium. The clinical presentation of a myxoma is related to intracardiac obstruction, embolization, and/or constitutional symptoms. Nearly \(70\%\) of patients with left atrial myxomas have cardiac symptoms, typically related to obstructive heart failure and syncope. Embolic events occur in approximately \(30\%\) of patients, with left atrial myxomas causing strokes and transient ischemic attacks and right atrial myxomas leading to pulmonary emboli. Myxomas may secrete interleukin- 6, an inflammatory cytokine associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and weight loss. Surgical resection of myxomas is warranted to relieve systemic or intracardiac obstructive symptoms and to prevent embolic complications.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 80: p.1505)  

Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) may occur "early," within the first 60 days after placement of the valve, or "late," in subsequent months or years. While this distinction is somewhat arbitrary, differences in both the clinical features and microbial patterns have been documented. Cases of early PVE usually are due to contamination in the immediate operative or perioperative setting. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism isolated in this group, occurring in approximately \(35\%\) of cases, of which one- quarter are methicillin resistant. Coagulase negative staphylococci account for approximately \(28\%\) of early PVE cases.  

In late cases, as in this question, the source of infection is often difficult to identify but is presumed to be seeding of the valve by transient bacteremia. Staphylococci are also the most common organisms responsible for late PVE, but less so than for early PVE (- 20% of late PVE results from coagulase negative staphylococci, and approximately \(19\%\) from S. aureus). Enterococci (- 13%) and Streptococcus viridans (- 11%) are less frequent causes of late PVE.  

The transesophageal echocardiographic image displayed demonstrates that the mitral valve prosthesis is well seated in the appropriate position. The prominent vegetations seen on the atrial side of the valve are well delineated and provide an example of the increased sensitivity of this form of echocardiography compared with transthoracic studies (as described in a subsequent answer).

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the management of patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis (AS). Randomized clinical trials have proven it to be a superior therapeutic option to medical therapy in patients at prohibitive risk for cardiac surgery, and noninferior (and in some cases superior) to surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) for patients at high, intermediate, or low levels of surgical risk. The best TAVR outcomes result when transfemoral arterial access is anatomically feasible, which is the case for most patients referred for the procedure. The decision of whether to proceed with surgical AVR versus TAVR should involve a multidisciplinary structural heart team, along with shared decision- making with the patient and family. The primary Class 1 recommendations for TAVR are listed in Table 4.1. In particular, TAVR is recommended for patients with severe symptomatic AS over age 80 years (patient B in this question) or those at very high or prohibitive surgical risk, while surgical AVR is appropriate for those younger than 65 years of age (patient C), because of uncertainty of transcatheter valve durability over the long term, the possibility of requiring a permanent pacemaker after TAVR, and anticipated need for additional invasive procedures for future TAVR dysfunction. In addition, TAVR outcomes in patients with a bicuspid valve (the major pathology in younger patients with severe AS) may vary based on anatomic considerations.  

For symptomatic AS patients 65 to 80 years of age with appropriate anatomy for transfemoral access (patient D), TAVR is an alternative to surgical AVR, after shared decision making with the patient. And in patients 80 years of age or younger with asymptomatic severe AS who have developed impaired left ventricular contractile function with ejection fraction less than \(50\%\) (patient A), TAVR is also a recommended alternative to surgical AVR.

Primary tumors of the heart are rare- autopsy series indicate a prevalence of \(0.001\%\) to \(0.03\%\) Metastatic tumors to the heart are far more common. Approximately threefourths of primary cardiac tumors are benign. The most common benign primary cardiac tumor in children is rhabdomyoma, and \(80\%\) of such tumors appear before the age of 1 year. Rhabdomyomas typically arise in the left ventricle. The majority of such patients have a history (or family history) or tuberous sclerosis.  

The most common malignant cardiac tumor in children is rhabdomyosarcoma. In adults, the most common benign primary cardiac tumor is the atrial myxoma. Lipomas and papillary fibroelastomas are the next most common benign primary tumors. The most frequent malignant primary tumor of the heart in adults is angiosarcoma, accounting for \(30\%\) to \(37\%\) of cases.

The patient described has the clinical signs and findings of type II glycogen storage disease. This disease is a consequence of the deficiency of alpha- 1,4- glucosidase (acid maltase), a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes glycogen into glucose. The condition commonly manifests in the neonatal period. Characteristic symptoms include failure to thrive, progressive hypotonia, lethargy, and a weak cry. Of all the glycogen storage diseases, type II (Pompe disease) is the most likely to cause cardiac symptoms. The ECG shows tall, broad QRS complexes with a short PR interval (commonly \(< 0.09\) second). The chest radiograph frequently shows cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular redistribution. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the enzymatic deficiency in lymphocytes, skeletal muscle, or liver. The myocardial biopsy (Fig. 4.35B) shows prominent vacuoles within the myocardial fibers, which contain glycogen. Normal myocardial histology is shown in Fig. 4.35A for comparison.  

Cardiac glycogenosis may be confused with other entities that cause cardiac failure, particularly in association with cardiomegaly in the early months of life. Endocardial fibroelastosis, a disease of unknown etiology, differs from Pompe disease in lacking the short PR interval and the fact that symptoms are limited to the cardiac system, whereas in Pompe disease skeletal muscle hypotonia is prominent. Furthermore, in endocardial fibroelastosis, mitral regurgitation and abnormalities of the cardiac valves, especially mitral and aortic, are frequent. Coarctation of the aorta, another cause of congestive heart failure in infants, can readily be distinguished by the presence of pulse and blood pressure discrepancies between the upper and lower extremities. Myocarditis, yet another cause of congestive

heart failure, is usually of abrupt onset and is not associated with hypotonia. Anomalous pulmonary origin of the left coronary artery can cause cardiomegaly but usually has a distinctive electrocardiographic pattern of anterolateral myocardial infarction.  

Shone syndrome is a developmental complex that consists of four obstructive anomalies: (1) a supravascular ring of the left atrium; (2) a parachute mitral valve; (3) subaortic stenosis; and (4) coarctation of the aorta. It typically manifests with findings of mitral stenosis because flow from the left atrium must pass through the abnormal intrathoridal spaces of the mitral valve, which poses functional obstruction. Pulmonary venous hypertension is a common finding in this condition because of left ventricular inflow and outflow obstruction. Shone syndrome manifests more often in early childhood than in infancy and lacks the skeletal muscle changes of Pompe disease.  

Friedreich ataxia is a hereditary autosomal recessive disease that manifests during late childhood with progressive ataxia. The limbs, in addition to being ataxic, generally show considerable weakness. Approximately \(50\%\) of patients with Friedreich ataxia have cardiac involvement, typically hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 450  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 86: p.1620)  

Cardiac tamponade occurs when the accumulation of pericardial fluid causes significant cardiac chamber compression. It is characterized by an increase in intrapericardial pressure and impedance to diastolic filling of the ventricles, with a consequent fall in cardiac output. Normal intrapericardial pressure is several millimeters of mercury lower than right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressures. As fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, intrapericardial pressure rises to, or exceeds, the level of right atrial (RA) and RV diastolic pressures, and tamponade physiology ensues.  

As intrapericardial and RV diastolic pressures rise toward the level of LV diastolic pressure, all three pressures equalize, leading to a marked decrease in transmural distending pressures, decreased filling, and to a fall in stroke volume. Cardiac output and blood pressure in this setting may initially be maintained by reflex tachycardia and increased vascular tone. However, as pericardial fluid further accumulates, compensatory mechanisms cannot maintain cardiac output, and blood pressure falls. Whereas tachycardia is the usual response to falling stroke volume, bradycardia can be seen in severe tamponade. Both the cardiac depression branches of the vagus nerve and sinoatrial node ischemia are believed to contribute to this phenomenon.  

Normal inspiration causes increased right- sided cardiac filling and shifting of the interventricular septum toward the left, accompanied by reduced LV filling as a manifestation of ventricular interdependence. This effect is exaggerated in tamponade because the ventricles are compressed and share a reduced total volume. Such proportionally greater reductions in LV filling and stroke volume with inspiration contribute to pulsus paradoxus.  

Echocardiographic features of tamponade include RA inversion and RV diastolic collapse. In the presence of concurrent pulmonary hypertension, the elevated right- sided pressures blunt the effect of right- sided chamber compression.

This woman presents with physical findings and symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). By history, the course of her illness is relatively rapid and includes systemic symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and episodes of rapid heartbeat, flushing, and diarrhea. The most likely diagnosis is carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid is a slowly growing neuroendocrine malignancy that leads to focal or diffuse deposits of fibrous tissue in the endocardium of the valvular cusps and cardiac chambers. The white, fibrous, carcinoid plaques are most extensive on the right side of the heart because vasoactive substances are released from hepatic metastases and drain through the inferior vena cava into the right atrium. This results in endocardial damage and fibrosis and causes the cusps of the tricuspid valve to adhere to the underlying right ventricle, producing TR (often accompanied by pulmonic valve disease on a similar basis, as described in a later question). Carcinoid syndrome is suggested by the coexistence of TR with flushing and diarrhea, which result from the release of vasoactive amines by the tumor cells.  

Other causes of isolated TR may be divided into those involving an anatomically abnormal valve (primary TR) and those with an anatomically normal valve (functional TR). The latter, in which TR is due to dilatation of the right ventricle and tricuspid annulus, is more common. The most frequent cause of functional TR is right ventricular (RV) hypertension, especially as a result of mitral valve disease, congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, or cor pulmonale. RV infarction may also cause functional TR.  

Certain disease processes may affect the tricuspid valve directly, leading to primary TR. Among these are (1) congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid valve (e.g., Ebstein anomaly or an atrioventricular canal defect); (2) rheumatic tricuspid valve disease (which is much less common than rheumatic mitral or aortic disease); (3) connective tissue disorders, including myxomatous redundancy of the leaflets; and (4) infective endocarditis. Deformation of tricuspid leaflets by pacemaker or defibrillator leads has become an increasingly common etiology of significant TR. Less common causes include endomyocardial fibroelastosis, trauma, cardiac tumors (particularly right atrial myxomas), repeated endomyocardial biopsies in a transplanted heart, or exposure to certain drugs, such as methysergide or the appetite suppressant dexfenfluramine.

B (Braunwald, Ch 80: p. 1505)This patient has right- sided endocarditis in the setting of illicit intravenous (IV) drug use. The echocardiographic image shows a large vegetation on the atrial surface of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (arrow in Fig. 4.36). Injection drug users with endocarditis most frequently demonstrate right- sided valvular involvement (the tricuspid valve in \(46\% - 78\%\) ), with less common involvement of the left- sided valves (mitral valve involvement in \(24\% - 32\%\) and aortic valve involvement in \(8\% - 19\%\) ); however, the latter group displays greater mortality. Staphylococcus aureus infections account for more than \(50\%\) of IV drug user endocarditis (and \(60\% - 70\%\) of those with tricuspid valve involvement), with the remainder caused by streptococcal species, gram- negative bacilli, and fungi. Pulmonary findings are frequent in those with right- sided endocarditis, with \(65\%\) to \(75\%\) displaying evidence of septic pulmonary emboli on chest radiograph. Other pulmonary complications include pulmonary infarction, abscess formation, and empyema. Serious cardiac complications include destruction of the tricuspid valve apparatus, with consequent severe regurgitation and right- sided heart failure.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 82: p. 1582)  

The patient has Eisenmenger syndrome, with currently exacerbated right- to- left shunting due to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) after starting alphablocker (tamsulosin) therapy. Thus, initial treatment should include augmenting the SVR (e.g., using the alpha agonist phenylephrine) and discontinuing the alpha blocker.  

Eisenmenger syndrome is characterized by irreversibly increased pulmonary vascular resistance with reversal of chronic left- to- right shunting to a bidirectional, or right- to- left, shunt direction, resulting in cyanosis. Shunts that may progress to Eisenmenger physiology include atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, atrioventricular canal defects, and univentricular hearts. Such patients may survive into adulthood, when the most common causes of mortality are sudden cardiac death, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage. The degree of right- to- left shunting in patients with Eisenmenger physiology is highly dependent on the SVR. For example, a decline in SVR (as a result of sepsis, hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency, anesthesia, or vasodilators), as in this case, augments the right- to- left shunt and further reduces systemic oxygen saturation.

The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) greatly reduced the incidence of cardiac manifestations in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In a recent cohort trial of HIV patients, most of whom received HAART, pericardial effusion was present in less than \(1\%\) . Conversely, in the setting of untreated HIV infection, pericardial effusions are common. Such effusions tend to be small, rarely cause symptoms, and may spontaneously resolve without specific intervention. Although cardiac tamponade rarely results, such effusions tend to occur in patients with lower CD4 counts and more advanced HIV disease and have been shown to be a marker for increased mortality.  

The causes of pericardial effusions in HIV infection include opportunistic infections and malignancy (e.g., Kaposi sarcoma or lymphoma); however, a definite etiology is often not found. In some cases, the development of effusions (pericardial and pleural) may occur as a result of a capillary leak phenomenon induced by elevated cytokine levels in patients with advanced HIV disease. Tuberculosis is the most common cause of pericardial effusion in African HIV patients.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 455
## B (Braunwald, Ch 82: p. 1557; see also Answer to Question 444)  

Common findings on physical examination of patients with an atrial septal defect (ASD) include a prominent right ventricular (RV) impulse, palpable pulmonary artery pulsations, accentuation of the tricuspid valve closure sound, and a midsystolic ejection murmur due to increased flow across the pulmonic valve. If the shunt is large, a mid- diastolic rumbling murmur may be audible at the lower left sternal border. This murmur results from increased blood flow across the tricuspid valve.  

The ECG may be helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected ASD. In the common ostium secundum ASD, the tracing may show right- axis deviation and an rSR' or rsR' pattern in the right precordial leads with a normal QRS complex duration. The presence of negative P waves in the inferior leads (indicating a low atrial pacemaker) suggests the presence of a sinus venosus- type ASD. Left- axis deviation and superior orientation of the QRS complex in the frontal plane is consistent with an ostium primum defect. Tall R or R' waves in \(\mathrm{V_1}\) may indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension and concomitant RV hypertrophy.  

The chest radiograph may reveal enlargement of the right atrium and right ventricle, pulmonary arterial dilatation, and increased pulmonary vascular markings. Echocardiographic evaluation of ASD may show pulmonary arterial and RV dilatation and paradoxical intraventricular septal motion if RV volume overload is present. The defect itself may be visualized by two- dimensional echocardiography, particularly on the subcostal view. Doppler interrogation reveals the presence and direction of the transatrial shunt and allows calculation of the \(\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{p}} / \mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{s}}\) ratio.

This patient displays the apical variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), evidenced on this echocardiographic apical long- axis (four- chamber) view. This variant is marked by predominant hypertrophy of the left ventricular apex, which causes the chamber to display a "spade- like" deformity on cardiac imaging. This is even more clearly demonstrated on this patient's subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study (arrows in Fig. 4.37). Apical HCM is rare in other parts of the world, but in Japan it accounts for \(25\%\) of patients with HCM. The ECG in this condition is frequently striking for deep, inverted T waves in the apical precordial leads. Intraventricular pressure gradients are usually absent. Symptoms associated with the apical variant tend to be milder, and the risk of sudden death is lower, compared with the septal form of HCM.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 457  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 76: p. 1470)  

Physical findings in mitral regurgitation (MR) are influenced by the compliance of the left atrium. In patients with severe, acute mitral regurgitation (e.g., due to rupture of chordae tendineae), the regurgitant volume encounters an unprepared, relatively noncompliant left atrium. As a result, the left atrial pressure quickly rises, which serves to limit the pressure gradient between the left ventricle and left atrium late in systole, causing the systolic murmur to shorten and end before the second heart sound. However, the acutely elevated left atrial pressure also augments the pulmonary venous pressure and commonly results in  

![](images/248_0.jpg)

<center>FIG. 4.37 LA, Left atrium; LV, left ventricle; RV, right ventricle. </center>

<--- Page Split --->

acute pulmonary edema, as well as findings of right- sided heart failure (e.g., jugular venous distention).  

In contrast, the more gradual development of chronic MR allows the left atrium to gradually dilate and increase its compliance, such that the chamber is able to accommodate larger volumes without a substantial increase in pressure. As a result, in compensated chronic MR, substantial elevation in pulmonary venous and capillary pressures is avoided. However, the mitral regurgitant volume returns to the left ventricle during diastole, resulting in gradual left ventricular enlargement. Thus, in distinction to acute MR, patients with chronic MR commonly demonstrate left ventricular and left atrial enlargement on cardiac imaging.

The tracing shows the simultaneous recording of left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) pressures and depicts the hemodynamic profile of mitral stenosis. The LA pressure is elevated (mean \(\sim 20 \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}\) ) with a prominent atrial contraction \((a)\) wave and an abnormally gradual pressure decline in diastole after mitral valve opening \((y\) descent). There is a persistent gradient between LA and LV pressure throughout diastole, in contrast to the normal situation, in which there is rapid equilibration of LA and LV pressures in diastole.  

Mitral regurgitation would be associated with prominent \(\upsilon\) waves on the LA pressure tracing, but not a persistent diastolic atrioventricular pressure gradient.  

In constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy, the atrial pressure decline in the earliest part of diastole is typically brisk (prominent \(y\) descent), the converse of this example.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 86: p. 1616-1617; Fig. 86.2)  

This patient has typical symptoms and signs of acute pericarditis. The majority of patients with pericarditis manifest electrocardiographic abnormalities. The most common early finding is global ST- segment elevation, particularly in the inferior, lateral, and apical leads. The ST- segment elevations are believed to represent a current of injury caused by superficial inflammation of the adjacent myocardium. In contrast to the acute ST- segment abnormalities of ST- elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the elevations in pericarditis tend to be oriented in a concave upward direction, and reciprocal ST- segment depressions in the opposite leads are not present. In later stages of pericarditis (days or weeks after presentation), the ST segment returns to baseline, and thereafter the T waves may deeply invert.   

The PR segment is found to be depressed (or elevated in lead aVR) in \(75\%\) to \(80\%\) of patients with acute pericarditis. This finding may be the result of abnormal atrial repolarization due to atrial inflammation and is not typical of other conditions such as acute STEMI. PR- segment depression may occur even in the absence of ST- segment elevation and can be the initial, or only, electrocardiographic manifestation of acute pericarditis. Sinus tachycardia is also a common finding in acute pericarditis, related to pericardial inflammation, pain, or fever.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 460  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 86: p. 1630)  

Two forms of pericarditis can follow acute myocardial infarction (MI): early and delayed. When present, early acute fibrinous pericarditis develops within the first few days after MI. The incidence and degree of such pericardial inflammation is associated with the size of the infarct. Acute percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolytic therapy for ST- elevation MI (STEMI), which limits infarct size, reduces the incidence of pericarditis. In addition, pericarditis is less common after non- ST- segment elevation infarction compared with STEMI. The use of heparin has not been associated with increased risk of pericarditis or tamponade. Clinical evidence of pericarditis can be found as early as 12 hours after MI, and the earliest sign may be a pericardial friction rub. In approximately \(70\%\) of patients, the rub may be accompanied by pleuritic chest pain.  

The appearance of symptoms and signs of pericarditis more than 10 days after MI is consistent with the second type of post- MI pericarditis, termed Dressler syndrome. This delayed phenomenon is believed to be autoimmune in origin and has become rare in the era of acute reperfusion therapies.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 54: p. 1063-1065)  

The tracing demonstrates simultaneous recordings of left ventricular (LV) and systemic pressure in a patient in normal sinus rhythm. The second electrocardiographic complex is a ventricular premature beat (VPB). The beat following the VPB demonstrates a rise in LV pressure due to postextrasystolic potentiation. However, the aortic systolic pressure and the pulse pressure decline in the post- VPB beat. This is an example of the Brockenbrough- Braunwald

<--- Page Split --->

phenomenon that is typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and is a reliable sign of dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction.  

In normal subjects, and even in those with valvular abnormalities such as aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation, a post- VPB contraction is associated with increased systolic aortic pressure and pulse pressure. Conversely, in HCM, the premature contraction increases the force of contraction and the degree of outflow obstruction of the subsequent beat, causing a decline in the pulse pressure. While increased ventricular filling during the post- VPB compensatory pause would be expected to reduce the outflow gradient in HCM, that effect is outweighed by the increased contractility associated with postextrasystolic potentiation. In addition to the narrowed pulse pressure, the peripheral arterial waveform may show a "spike- and- dome" configuration, reflecting the attenuation of LV output due to dynamic outflow obstruction.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 462  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 77: p. 1479)  

The color Doppler profile in part \(A\) of the figure demonstrates systolic turbulence due to valvular pulmonic stenosis. As quantitated by the continuous Doppler profile in part \(B\) the peak velocity across the valve is approximately \(4.0\mathrm{m / second}\) corresponding to a peak transpulmonary valve systolic gradient of \(64\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) (calculated from the simplified Bernoulli equation, \(P = 4\nu^2\) ). Thus, in light of his chest discomfort, this patient likely has symptomatic pulmonic stenosis (PS).  

PS is most commonly due to congenital deformity of the valve; much less- common causes are carcinoid plaques or rheumatic inflammation. Congenital PS is characterized by fused leaflets and doming of the valve in systole with a narrowed opening. Typical features on physical examination include a prominent jugular venous \(a\) wave (due to secondary right ventricular hypertrophy), a systolic ejection click, a crescendo- decrescendo ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border, and a widely split \(\mathrm{S}_2\) Unlike other right- sided valvular lesions, the systolic click decreases in intensity with inspiration (with inspiration, the augmented right- sided filling elevates the leaflets into the pulmonary artery prior to RV contraction, preempting the rapid tensing in early systole that is thought to produce the sound).  

Mechanical treatment of PS is indicated for symptomatic patients with a mean transvalvular gradient of \(30\mathrm{mm}\) Hg (or higher) or a peak systolic gradient of \(50\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) or higher. In asymptomatic patients, intervention is usually recommended for a mean gradient greater than \(50\mathrm{mm}\) Hg. The intervention of choice is transcatheter balloon valvuloplasty, which has shown excellent short- and medium- term results. For patients with prominently dysplastic valves, balloon valvotomy may not offer sufficient gradient relief, such that pulmonary valve replacement becomes necessary.

The most common significant congenital cardiac malformation is ventricular septal defect, followed in frequency by atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent ductus arteriosus. These data do not include the common anomalies of a congenital, functionally normal bicuspid aortic valve and mitral valve prolapse.  

Specific defects show a sex predilection. For example, patent ductus arteriosus and ASDs are more common in females, whereas valvular aortic stenosis, congenital aneurysms of the sinus of Valsalva, coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, and transposition of the great arteries are seen more frequently in males. Extracardiac anomalies occur in approximately \(25\%\) of infants born with significant cardiac disease and often are multiple.  

Approximately one- third of infants with both cardiac and extracardiac anomalies have an established syndrome. For example, maternal rubella during pregnancy is associated with the rubella syndrome, which consists of cataracts, deafness, microcephaly, and some combination of patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonic valvular or arterial stenosis or both, and ASD. Maternal systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy has been linked to congenital complete heart block, but not to any specific anatomic abnormality.

The American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE) enumerate the type of patients for whom antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. The statement recognizes that (1) IE is more likely to occur after random bacteremias (e.g., after daily tooth brushing) than from dental and/or genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures; and (2) because prophylaxis may prevent only a small number of cases of IE, the risk of antibiotic use in many cases may outweigh the benefit.  

According to current guidelines, prophylaxis is only recommended for those patients with cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of complications from endocarditis, including the presence of (1) prosthetic cardiac valves or other prosthetic material for valve repair, (2) previous IE, (3) cardiac transplantation recipients with valvular lesions, and (4) specific types of congenital heart disease (unrepaired cyanotic lesions, repaired congenital lesions with residual defects, or during the first 6 months after repair with prosthetic material or devices). Prophylaxis is not recommended for other valvular abnormalities such as mitral valve prolapse with murmur.

A (Braunwald, Ch 88: p. 1658; eFig 88.1; Fig. 88.2)The prognostic importance of elevated right atrial pressure on mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension has been demonstrated in large patient registries. Although increased mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) is also associated with increased mortality, mPAP may decrease as right ventricular failure progresses. Therefore, a normal or low mPAP may be present despite the presence of end- stage pulmonary vascular disease. Diastolic flattening on echocardiography indicates right heart volume overload but is not specific for pulmonary arterial hypertension. A low transpulmonary gradient (calculated as the difference between mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure) is indicative of an elevated left ventricular end- diastolic pressure relative to pulmonary artery pressure and excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Homograft (also known as allograft) aortic valves are harvested from human cadavers, usually within 24 hours of death, sterilized, cryopreserved, and then placed directly into the's heart without the use of a prosthetic stent. Often the valve is implanted with a portion of attached donor aorta as a root replacement, with reimplantation of the coronaries into the graft. Aortic homografts provide potential advantages. The rate of thromboembolism is low, similar to that of animal- derived bioprosthetic valves, and therefore lifelong anticoagulation is not necessary. They provide a more physiologic hemodynamic profile than mechanical valves, and, because a prosthetic support stent is not used, they are also hemodynamically superior to stented porcine tissue valves. In addition, homografts have been considered to be more resistant to infection than other prostheses, so they are often chosen for patients with infective endocarditis of the aortic valve, particularly when complex root anatomy is present.  

In experienced hands, the surgical mortality related to homograft placement is \(1\%\) to \(2\%\) , similar to that of other valve replacements. The rate of structural degeneration of cryopreserved homografts has been similar to that of porcine xenografts. In one recent retrospective review of 840 cryopreserved aortic allografts, durability exceeded 15 years in middle- aged and older patients. The estimated median time until structural deterioration in this study was 20 years.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 75:p.1445; Fig.75.4)  

The echocardiographic image demonstrates diastolic. coming of the mitral valve leaflets, typical of rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS). Patients with preserved flexibility of the leaflets in MS (i.e., fusion confined to the valve commissures) demonstrate an accentuated \(\mathrm{S_1}\) . This is thought to occur because the persistent pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle at the end of diastole keeps the flexible portion of the leaflets in a maximally separated position prior to ventricular contraction. Contraction then forces the leaflets together from a relatively wide position, causing the intensity of \(\mathrm{S_1}\) to be loud. If, however, the valve is markedly calcified, there is little movement of the leaflets during the cardiac cycle, such that \(\mathrm{S_1}\) becomes abnormally soft.  

The opening snap occurs when the left ventricular diastolic pressure falls below that of the left atrium, and the stenotic mitral leaflets open. The more severe the mitral stenosis, the higher the left atrial pressure becomes, such that mitral opening occurs earlier, and therefore the interval between \(\mathrm{A_2}\) and the opening snap shortens. In patients with long- standing MS, pulmonary hypertension develops, in part because of the chronically elevated left atrial pressure. As a result, \(\mathrm{P_2}\) becomes accentuated. The intensity of the diastolic murmur is not a good guide to the severity of mitral stenosis. A more reliable sign is the duration of the murmur: increasing severity of stenosis causes greater persistence of the gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle, and therefore the murmur lasts longer in diastole.

The murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR) is of high frequency and begins immediately after \(\mathrm{A_2}\) . It is best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope applied firmly while the patient is sitting up and leaning forward, with the breath held in expiration. The severity of regurgitation correlates better with the duration rather than severity of the murmur, and in cases of severe AR, a holodiastolic murmur with a "rough" quality may be heard. However, with the development of heart failure, equilibration of aortic and left ventricular diastolic pressures abolishes the late diastolic component and the murmur becomes shorter. When the murmur is musical ("cooing dove" murmur), it usually signifies eversion or perforation of a cusp. Regurgitation due to primary aortic valve disease is usually loudest at

<--- Page Split --->

the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. When the murmur is loudest at the right side of the sternum, it usually indicates the presence of a dilated ascending aorta as the cause of valvular insufficiency. In general, maneuvers that increase afterload, such as a strenuous handgrip, augment aortic regurgitation and the associated murmur.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 469  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 86: pp. 1623, 1630)  

Bacterial (purulent) pericarditis arises from one of several mechanisms, including hematogenous seeding during bacteremia, contiguous spread of infection after thoracic surgery, or via rupture of a perivascular abscess in endocarditis. The majority of occurrences, however, are attributable to direct extension from an adjacent pulmonary infection. Several factors predispose to the development of purulent pericarditis, including a preexisting pericardial effusion in uremic pericarditis, or in immunosuppressed states such as hematologic malignancies or following severe burns. Bacterial pericarditis is usually an acute fulminant illness of rapid onset that is characterized by high spiking fevers, rigors, night sweats, and dyspnea. Typical symptoms of pericarditis may be absent, and the process may be heralded by new jugular venous distention and pulsus paradoxus as a result of cardiac tamponade.  

Despite the lower incidence of purulent pericarditis in the antibiotic era, overall survival is poor, with a mortality of approximately \(30\%\) in most series. The poor prognosis is in large part due to delayed diagnosis, as well as disease severity and comorbidities. Early complete drainage (via pericardiocentesis and usually surgical drainage) and parenteral antibiotic therapy are critical. High concentrations of antibiotics are achieved in pericardial fluid with parenteral therapy; therefore, instillation of antibiotics directly into the pericardial space is not warranted.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is often functional, i.e., related to ventricular and/or atrial remodeling with subsequent leaflet tethering. In these patients, primary management is directed at optimizing guideline- directed heart failure therapies, including biventricular pacing when indicated.  

For patients who have persistent symptomatic severe MR despite optimal guideline- based therapy, transcatheter edge- to- edge repair (TEER) has emerged as a treatment option. TEER requires femoral venous access with transseptal puncture to enter the left atrium, after which the device is positioned across the mitral valve and a clip that grasps the anterior and posterior leaflets is deployed; multiple clips may be used. The result is similar to the Alfieri stitch operation, in which the P2 and A2 (middle) scallops of the mitral valve are sutured together, creating a double- orifice mitral valve that reduces the degree of regurgitation.  

In the COAPT (Clinical Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for High Risk Surgical Patients) trial, individuals with heart failure (mean LVEF \(31\%\) ) and moderate- to- severe MR who underwent TEER had lower rates of hospitalization for heart failure and reduction in all- cause mortality over 24 months compared with patients treated with continued medical therapy alone. However, similar benefit was not observed in the MITRA- FR (Multicentre Randomized Study of Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair MitraClip Device in Patients with Severe Secondary Mitral Regurgitation) trial, which included patients with more extreme left ventricular (LV) dilatation and less marked MR. Therefore, current selection criteria for TEER for secondary MR follow the entry criteria for COAPT: LVEF \(20\%\) to \(50\%\) , LV end- systolic diameter \(70 \mathrm{mm}\) or less, pulmonary artery systolic pressure \(70 \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}\) or less and persistent heart failure symptoms on guideline- directed medical therapy.  

Preprocedural evaluation with transesophageal echocardiography is critical to determine candidacy for TEER. The central segments of the mitral valve (P2/A2) are usually the most appropriate for TEER, whereas the medial segments (P3/A3) are often most difficult to clip due to challenges in positioning the device. Additionally, the leaflets must be of adequate length and have an adequate coaptation gap.  

Patients with untreated high grade coronary artery disease typically benefit from simultaneous coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve surgery and thus were excluded from the COAPT trial.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 80: pp.1523-1524)  

Detection of the presence of vegetations by echocardiography is not mandatory to establish the diagnosis of endocarditis. Although the sensitivity of transesophageal echocardiography to detect vegetations in suspected endocarditis is \(85\%\) to \(95\%\) , the sensitivity of transthoracic echocardiography is substantially less. Staphylococcus aureus is an aggressive organism that results in rapid destruction of valves and perivalvular tissue. Nonetheless, antibiotic therapy alone is often curative for native valve endocarditis caused by this organism.  

Vegetations greater than \(10\mathrm{mm}\) in diameter pose a greater risk of thromboembolism than smaller vegetations, but it has not been definitively demonstrated that early surgical intervention in patients with larger vegetations improves long- term outcome; early surgical intervention is an American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology class IIb indication for such patients. Although cerebral embolism can be a devastating complication of endocarditis, the rate of recurrence declines during the course of appropriate antibiotic treatment. Patients with endocarditis and intractable heart failure due to valve dysfunction have a \(55\%\) to \(85\%\) mortality rate when treated medically; the mortality falls to \(10\%\) to \(30\%\) with early surgical intervention.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 473  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 86:p.1630)  

Although tuberculosis pericarditis is now uncommon in industrialized countries, the disease continues to be an important problem in developing nations and in immunosuppressed patients and is the most common cause of pericardial disease in human immunodeficiency virus patients in Africa. Tuberculous pericarditis usually develops by retrograde spread from peritracheal, peribronchial, or mediastinal lymph nodes or by early hematogenous spread from the primary tuberculous infection. The process is usually chronic, with the gradual development of pericardial effusion. Symptoms may be systemic and nonspecific, and clinical detection of tuberculous pericarditis often does not occur until the effusive or late constrictive pericarditic stages are reached. The typical pericardial chest pain of acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis is uncommon in tuberculous pericarditis. In addition, typical signs and symptoms of cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis are usually absent.   

Examination of patients with tuberculous pericarditis may reveal evidence of chronic cardiac compression, which can mimic heart failure. Common symptoms include cough, dyspnea, orthopnea, weight loss, and peripheral edema. Definitive diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis is usually difficult because of the low yield of the bacillus in pericardial fluid, frequent failure to culture the organism, and/or the need to observe cultures for a minimum of 8 weeks. The probability of a definitive diagnosis is greatest if both pericardial fluid and a pericardial biopsy are obtained in the effusive stage of the disease. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of pericardial specimens offers the potential to obtain results more rapidly than standard cultures, but its sensitivity is low. Measurement of pericardial fluid adenosine deaminase is diagnostically useful, with reported sensitivity and specificity for tuberculous pericarditis of \(88\%\) and \(83\%\) , respectively.  

Initial therapy for tuberculous pericarditis includes a three- drug regimen ordinarily consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, and streptomycin or ethambutol. The role of corticosteroids remains unclear. Studies have failed to show that the early use of corticosteroids affects mortality or progression to constriction, although such therapy may shorten the duration of symptoms.

A (Braunwald, Ch 52: p. 1048; see also Answerto Question 451)This patient has findings of carcinoid syndrome, characterized by episodic flushing, diarrhea, and bronchoconstriction. The majority of carcinoid tumors originate in the appendix and other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, with the remainder arising in the respiratory tract. Carcinoid tumors vasoactive substances, including serotonin and bradykinin, which are inactivated by the liver, lungs, and brain. However, in the presence of large hepatic metastases, these vasoactive substances reach the systemic circulation and heart. Cardiovascular involvement occurs in up to two- thirds of patients with carcinoid syndrome and includes the formation of fibrous plaques in the right heart endocardium, which can lead to fixation and retraction of the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. This results in tricuspid and/or pulmonic valve dysfunction and eventual right- sided heart failure. Higher circulating serotonin levels are associated with greater severity and progression of cardiac disease. Left- sided heart involvement is not common (occurring in \(< 10\%\) of patients), presumably because of pulmonary inactivation of the vasoactive hormones. Patients who do develop left- sided disease may have a right- to- left intracardiac shunt or a primary pulmonary carcinoid tumor. It is rare for a carcinoid tumor to actually metastasize to the heart.

Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (BMV) is the treatment of choice for patients with mitral stenosis who require mechanical intervention. Surgical valve repair or replacement is reserved for patients who are not candidates for the percutaneous procedure. In the most commonly practiced form of BMV, a catheter is maneuvered across the interatrial septum through a small septal puncture, and a balloon device is advanced across the mitral valve. Balloon inflation separates and fractures the calcified valve commissures, improving the transmitral gradient, valve area, and cardiac output. Selection of patients for this approach is usually determined by echocardiographic features including (1) mitral valve rigidity, (2) leaflet thickening, (3) valve calcification, and (4) subvalvular apparatus thickening and calcification. In a commonly used scoring system, each of these factors is assigned a score from 0 to 4, with 0 representing the absence of each abnormality and 4 representing the most severe form. A total score of 8 or under is associated with excellent results after balloon valvuloplasty. Transesophageal echocardiography is typically performed before the procedure to exclude the presence of left atrial thrombus, a potential source of embolism during catheter manipulation.  

The major complications of BMV include death \((1\% - 2\%)\) , thromboembolism \((1\% - 2\%)\) , cardiac perforation \((1\%)\) , and severe mitral regurgitation requiring surgical repair \((- 2\%)\) . A small residual iatrogenic atrial septal defect persists in approximately \(5\%\) of patients and is rarely hemodynamically significant.

## A (Braunwald, Ch 86: p. 1620)  

The incidence of cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma varies by mode of injury and criteria for diagnosis, but ranges from \(10\%\) to \(50\%\) . Potential cardiac complications include septal rupture, free wall rupture, coronary artery thrombosis, rupture of chordae tendineae or papillary muscles, and dysrhythmias. Immediate evaluation should include assessment for cardiac tamponade (hypotension, pulsus paradoxus, distended jugular veins, muffled heart sounds). Chest radiography is an important part of the evaluation that can identify pneumothorax, bony fractures, or an enlarged cardiac silhouette suggesting pericardial effusion. Echocardiography identifies traumatic blood in the pericardial space, but a transthoracic study has limited value in identifying other consequences of blunt trauma, as accompanying chest wall injuries typically render the study technically limited. Conversely, transesophageal echocardiography is sensitive in identifying the effects of blunt injury, including traumatic ventricular septal defects, rupture of chordae tendineae or portions of papillary muscle with valvular insufficiency, and wall motion abnormalities.   

The most common electrocardiographic abnormalities in blunt cardiac trauma are sinus tachycardia and ventricular premature beats. Other ECG findings can include ST- segment abnormalities, atrioventricular blocks, right bundle branch block (with or without left anterior fascicular block), atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia. Although debate exists over the role of cardiac- specific biomarker elevations after chest trauma, studies have not shown a consistent correlation between cardiac troponin levels and the presence and prognosis of blunt cardiac injury.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 53: p.1060)  

Cardiac sarcoidosis was previously thought to occur in approximately \(5\%\) of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis based on clinical findings, but recent imaging studies have demonstrated cardiac involvement in greater than \(25\%\) of patients with pulmonary sarcoid. The pathologic feature of cardiac sarcoidosis is the presence of noncaseating granulomas in the myocardium that result in ventricular dysfunction and eventually become fibrotic scars. The granulomas may involve any region of the heart, but the left ventricular (LV) free wall and interventricular septum are the most common sites. Infiltration of the conduction system may lead to atrioventricular (AV) block, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are also common. Sudden death is the most common cause of mortality in sarcoid heart disease, potentially resulting from paroxysmal ventricular arrhythmias or high- grade AV block. Involvement of cardiac valves is unusual. Although the murmur of mitral regurgitation is often present, it typically results from LV dilatation or papillary muscle involvement rather than from sarcoid infiltration of the valve.  

Percutaneous myocardial biopsy may be useful in establishing the diagnosis of sarcoid heart disease. However, cardiac involvement tends to be patchy, such that biopsy is often low yield, and a negative biopsy does not exclude the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a more sensitive modality for the diagnosis. Delayed gadolinium enhancement in this condition is usually nontransmural, typically appearing at the basal and/ or midventricular septum. Fluoro deoxyglucose positron emission tomography is another useful imaging modality that reveals regions of inflammation in active sarcoid and can be used to monitor the response to anti- inflammatory therapies.  

It is common to administer glucocorticoid therapy to patients with evidence of sarcoid heart disease, though the benefit of this approach has not been confirmed in randomized trials. In patients who do not respond, methotrexate is commonly used, based on experienced opinion. Management of arrhythmias may require permanent pacing and/or

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 478  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 82: p. 1558)  

The size of ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and the degree to which pulmonary vascular resistance is altered determine the clinical presentation. In general, adults with small defects are asymptomatic and are not at risk for the development of pulmonary vascular obstructive disease. However, all individuals with ventricular septal defects are at increased risk for infective endocarditis, which arises in up to \(4\%\) of patients with VSDs. The infection usually develops in the right ventricle at the site where shunted blood impacts the ventricular wall.  

In an asymptomatic individual, a VSD with a normal pulmonary artery pressure and a pulmonary:systemic flow ratio less than 1.5:1 generally does not require surgical closure. Women with VSDs and pulmonary:systemic flow ratios less than 2:1 with only modest pulmonary hypertension generally tolerate pregnancy well. In women with larger left- to- right shunts, however, left ventricular failure may occur during pregnancy. In those who have Eisenmenger complex, pregnancy is poorly tolerated, with a maternal mortality between \(40\%\) and \(45\%\)  

The development of Eisenmenger complex due to progressive pulmonary vascular disease is one of the most serious complications of VSDs. This usually develops in early adulthood, in the second or third decade of life, and may be complicated by heart failure, hemoptysis, chest pain, cerebral abscess, thromboembolism, and sudden death.

Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF), a cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy, is found primarily in tropical and subtropical Africa, but has been increasingly recognized in tropical regions of South America, Asia, and the Middle East. It arises most commonly in children and young adults and only occasionally manifests in older individuals. It results in fibrous obliteration of the apex of the affected ventricle(s) and typically involves the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae. EMF affects both ventricles in approximately \(50\%\) of patients, purely the left ventricle in \(40\%\) and solely the right ventricle in \(10\%\) . Its cause remains unknown.   

Echocardiographic features include increased endocardial reflectivity, fibrotic obliteration of the affected ventricular apex, atrial enlargement, and pericardial effusion. Fibrotic lesions of the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae distort the valve apparatus and, in the case of the left ventricle, lead to mitral regurgitation.  

Clinical features of EMF depend on which of the ventricles is involved: left- sided disease manifests as pulmonary congestion, and right- sided involvement may manifest as symptoms and signs similar to other restrictive cardiomyopathy or constrictive pericarditis. The clinical course of EMF tends to be progressive and complications include heart failure and thromboemboli, because the fibrotic tissue provides a site for thrombus formation. Up to \(50\%\) of patients with advanced disease die within 2 years.

Among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), ICD implantation is appropriate for those at greatest risk of sudden death (SD). Those with prior cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia warrant an ICD, while an ICD should be considered for primary prevention in HCM patients with any of the following high- risk predictors of SD: recent unexplained syncope (especially in a young patient), a family history of HCM- related sudden death, a hypotensive response to exercise testing, multiple nonsustained bursts of VT on ambulatory monitoring, those with marked LV hypertrophy (wall thickness \(\geq 30 \mathrm{mm}\) ), left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, or apical aneurysm. Patients with extensive late gadolinium enhancement on contrast- enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (involving \(\geq 15\%\) of the LV mass) are also at high risk of SD, and prophylactic ICD implantation might be considered in such individuals.  

Most studies have failed to establish a clear association between the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient in HCM and risk of sudden death. Thus, an elevated LVOT gradient is not considered an indication for ICD placement in the absence of other risk factors.

Classic tetralogy of Fallot is marked by a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) in association with infundibular or valvular pulmonic stenosis or both, right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. In all cases, the VSD

<--- Page Split --->

is located proximal to the level of the RV outflow tract obstruction and is therefore associated with elevated RV systolic pressure and right- to- left shunting. This is in contrast to the situation in patients who have a double- chambered right ventricle and a membranous VSD, in whom the septal defect communicates with the low- pressure distal portion of the right ventricle and leads to simple VSD physiology rather than the right- to- left shunting and cyanosis that mark tetralogy of Fallot.  

Symptoms and clinical findings of tetralogy of Fallot depend on the severity of RV outflow tract obstruction. With only mild obstruction, a left- to- right shunt through the VSD is predominant, and the patient may remain acyanotic. The condition in patients with RV obstruction severe enough to cause cyanosis usually is recognized during infancy or early childhood; such patients may then undergo palliative or total surgical repair. Patients with uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot who survive into adult life usually have at most moderate obstruction to RV outflow, in association with relatively well- preserved pulmonary blood flow.  

Because the large VSD allows for decompression of the right ventricle in tetralogy of Fallot, the RV systolic pressure does not exceed that in the aorta, even in the presence of severe obstruction to RV outflow. Congestive heart failure is unusual in patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Instead, a decrease in cardiac reserve in adults with this condition is more typical, with symptoms of dyspnea and limited exercise tolerance.  

Associated anomalies in patients with tetralogy of Fallot include a right aortic arch in approximately \(25\%\) and coronary anomalies in approximately \(5\%\) .

The HACEK group of organisms refers to a number of fastidious gram- negative bacilli that colonize the oropharynx and upper respiratory tract and are a cause of community- acquired subacute endocarditis. The HACEK organisms include Haemophilus species, Aggregatibacter species, Cardioacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella species. Although they are fastidious and slow growing, HACEK organisms can usually be detected in blood cultures within 5 days. Native valve endocarditis with HACEK organisms have been associated with large vegetations and a high frequency of systemic emboli.

Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is a rare disorder of infants in which there is thickening of the endocardium due to deposition of collagen and elastin. This entity is distinct from endomyocardial fibrosis (see Answer to Question 479), a tropical and subtropical condition in which there is prominent myocardial involvement and, commonly, eosinophilia. EFE does not appear to be a specific disease, but rather a reaction in the first 1 to 2 years of life to stressors that include viral infections (including mumps exposure during fetal life), metabolic disorders, and congenital left- sided obstructive lesions. Recent reports also implicate mitochondrial disorders and placental insufficiency as causative. EFE predominantly involves the left ventricle and usually progresses to severe congestive heart failure and death.   

The echocardiographic finding of a highly reflective endocardial surface of the ventricle suggests the presence of endocardial fibroelastosis.

The Fontan procedure, developed originally for tricuspid atresia, involves surgical diversion of systemic venous return directly to the pulmonary arteries without passing through a subpulmonary ventricle. It is a palliative, not curative, operation. The majority of patients (- 90%) are in functional class I or II 5 years after the operation, but progressive deterioration over time is typical. The most common causes of death are congestive heart failure and arrhythmias.  

Physical findings after the Fontan procedure include an elevated nonpulsatile jugular venous pulse and a single \(\mathrm{S}_2\) (the pulmonary artery is typically tied off).  

Supraventricular arrhythmias are common (especially atrial fibrillation and flutter), observed in \(15\%\) to \(20\%\) of patients by 5 years after the operation, and the development of such arrhythmias can lead to hemodynamic deterioration and heart failure. Thromboemboli occur in \(6\%\) to \(25\%\) of patients, sources of which include atrial arrhythmias, right atrial dilatation with blood stasis, and the potentially thrombogenic material used to construct the circuit.  

Protein- losing enteropathy (PLE) develops in \(4\%\) to \(13\%\) of patients, and 5- year survival in this subgroup is approximately \(50\%\) . This complication is diagnosed by the finding of low plasma alpha<sub>1</sub>- antitrypsin levels and high alpha<sub>1</sub>- antitrypsin stool clearance. Chronically elevated systemic venous pressure with resultant intestinal lymphangiectasia and protein leakage has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PLE.

A primary hypercoagulable state (inherited thrombophilia) should be suspected when a patient presents with

<--- Page Split --->

deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the absence of a predisposing condition such as trauma, prolonged bed rest, or malignancy. Activated protein C (aPC) resistance is a form of thrombophilia in which aPC cannot appropriately cleave and inactivate coagulation factor V. This is caused by a single point mutation in the factor V gene, known as the factor V Leiden mutation, that abolishes a protein C cleavage site. Because factor V is critical in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and subsequent clot formation, the inability to inactivate it leads to a hypercoagulable state and triples the risk of DVT. This mutation has been found in nearly \(20\%\) of unselected patients with DVT.  

The prothrombin gene 20210 mutation (a single G- to- A substitution at nucleotide position 20210) results in increased levels of prothrombin and doubles the risk of DVT. It has been identified in \(5\%\) to \(8\%\) of patients with venous thrombosis, whereas protein C deficiency has been found in \(2\%\) to \(4\%\) , protein S deficiency in \(2\%\) to \(5\%\) , and antithrombin deficiency in \(1\%\) to \(3\%\) .

This man has classic findings of sleep apnea, with daytime sleepiness, nighttime snoring with apnea, nocturnal awakenings, and automobile accidents due to falling asleep at the wheel. Specific findings include paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, morning headaches, cardiac arrhythmias, truncal obesity, pulmonary hypertension, nocturnal enuresis, peripheral edema, hypertension, and an elevated hematocrit on laboratory examination.  

Patterns of sleep- disordered breathing include central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea. In central apnea, there is impaired central nervous system control of respiratory effort. Conversely, in obstructive apnea, the upper airway becomes transiently obstructed, causing airflow to stop despite continuing efforts of the respiratory muscles. Affected patients experience apneic periods, which can occur between 40 and 100 times per hour. During prolonged periods of apnea, the \(\mathrm{Po}_2\) can fall to values as low as 20 to \(25\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) with oxygen saturation less than \(50\%\) . Sustained hypoxemia of this type leads to arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, long asystoles, frequent atrial premature beats, and ventricular arrhythmias. Pulmonary hypertension may develop with secondary right ventricular hypertrophy.  

An effective therapy for many patients with obstructive sleep apnea is positive airway pressure (PAP), applied during sleep via mask or nasal prongs. Patients treated with PAP demonstrate improved neuropsychiatric function and reduced daytime somnolence. Nocturnal desaturation, pulmonary hypertension, and right- sided heart failure findings can all improve with this technique. For patients who have difficulty using PAP therapy, an oral appliance is another option. Refractory forms of obstructive sleep apnea may require palatal corrective surgery.  

Treatment for central sleep apnea is focused on management of contributory underlying conditions (e.g., heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) and often continuous PAP therapy.

This patient with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) after a prolonged airplane flight is hemodynamically stable without signs of right heart strain. Initial management should focus on anticoagulation therapy. In the absence of pregnancy, active cancer, or severely reduced renal function, effective anticoagulant approaches include: (1) subcutaneous low- molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by oral warfarin (which requires \(\sim 5\) days of overlap to prevent the procoagulant effect of unopposed warfarin monotherapy) or (2) use of non- vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). NOACs are noninferior to warfarin in treatment of VTE and cause less serious bleeding.  

NOACs that are approved for treatment of VTE include the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Dabigatran and edoxaban require at least 5 days of pretreatment with a parenteral anticoagulant such as LMWH. Rivaroxaban and apixaban do not require preceding parenteral anticoagulation. Approved standard regimens for these agents are:  

- Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, then 20 mg daily- Apixaban 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 5 mg twice daily- Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, after 5 or more days of a parenteral anticoagulant- Edoxaban 60 mg daily (if creatinine clearance [Ccr] is 50 to 95 mL/minute; 30 mg daily if Ccr ≤15 to 50 mL/minute, or if weight ≤60 kg, or patient takes a potent P-glycoprotein inhibitor such as verapamil), after 5 or more days of a parenteral anticoagulant  

Of the provided choices in the question, selection D would therefore be the most appropriate drug and dosage for this patient with normal renal function.

<--- Page Split --->

of cardiomyopathy, as familial forms are believed to be responsible for \(20\%\) to \(30\%\) of what were once classified as idiopathic DCMs.  

Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is rarely helpful in identifying the etiology of DCM, because the findings are often nonspecific. Furthermore, a negative biopsy does not rule out active viral myocarditis, because the myocardial damage may be focal and not included in the biopsy specimen. EMB is more helpful in patients with fulminant new- onset heart failure, for example when giant cell myocarditis is suspected, to establish the diagnosis and direct therapy. In contrast to EMB, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has high diagnostic accuracy for the presence of global or focal myocarditis and further can identify infiltrative or ischemic contributions to DCM.  

When viral myocarditis is suspected, acute and convalescent serologic testing can be obtained to confirm a viral cause, but the findings are not available sufficiently rapidly to affect management. Myocardial damage in viral myocarditis is believed to be due to cell- mediated immunologic recognition of new antigens expressed on myocardial cells by the infecting virus, although direct invasion of the myocardium and production of a myocardial toxin may play a role. As a result of myocardial cell destruction, serum myocardial markers, including the cardiac troponins, can be elevated in active myocarditis even in the absence of coronary artery disease. Because of the immunologic nature of cell death, it stands to reason that corticosteroid therapy would be beneficial in the treatment of acute myocarditis. However, randomized trial data to date indicate that immunosuppressive therapy for acute viral myocarditis does not significantly affect left ventricular function or survival.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 489  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 54: p. 1062)  

The M- mode and cardiac magnetic resonance images demonstrate marked asymmetric septal hypertrophy in this patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, on the M- mode tracing, the motion of the mitral valve is abnormal: the anterior leaflet moves anteriorly during systole, toward the interventricular septum, consistent with dynamic outflow tract obstruction. The patient should be advised to refrain from competitive sports, because such activity may increase the likelihood of syncope and sudden death. Initial medical therapy for this disorder includes beta blocker therapy, to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and lower the outflow gradient in patients with dynamic obstruction.  

Diuretics should generally be avoided, or administered carefully, in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) to prevent intravascular volume depletion and intensification of the outflow gradient. Digoxin should be avoided in HCM in the absence of systolic dysfunction; the increased inotropic effect could exacerbate the left ventricular outflow gradient. HCM is not an indication for routine antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.

This patient's clinical history and hemodynamic data are consistent with pulmonary vascular disease, with increased mean pulmonary artery pressure (normal \(< 25 \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}\) ) and pulmonary vascular resistance (normal \(< 2.5\) Wood units) but a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The pulmonary angiogram in the figure demonstrates abrupt tapering and cutoff of vessels with decreased opacification of the medium and small pulmonary arterioles, consistent with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Unlike other forms of pulmonary hypertension, surgical pulmonary endarterectomy is the definitive treatment for CTEPH, typically resulting in improved symptoms and hemodynamics.

The provided apical four- chamber view demonstrates biventricular increased wall thickness, enlarged atria, and a small pericardial effusion, which are typical findings of cardiac amyloidosis. Systemic amyloidosis represents a collection of pathologic disorders that result in the extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteins in organs and tissues. The most common form is primary (AL) amyloidosis, which is associated with plasma cell dyscrasias such as multiple myeloma. Cardiac involvement occurs in approximately \(50\%\) of patients with AL amyloidosis, and the most common presentation is that of restrictive cardiomyopathy. In such cases, right- sided heart failure findings predominate on physical examination.  

Another presentation of cardiac amyloidosis is congestive heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, generally a later finding. In approximately \(10\%\) of patients with amyloidosis, orthostatic hypotension occurs and is presumed to be a result of amyloid infiltration of the autonomic nervous system. A fourth, rare presentation of cardiac amyloidosis infiltration is impaired cardiac impulse formation and conduction. Such patients present with arrhythmias and conduction disturbances and sudden death may occur.  

Although not obvious in this example, the echocardiographic findings in cardiac amyloidosis may include a distinctive granular, sparkling appearance of the thickened cardiac walls, representative of the infiltrative process. Despite the thickened ventricular walls, the ECG in cardiac amyloidosis typically demonstrates low limb lead voltage, often accompanied by ventricular conduction delay and pseudoinfarction patterns.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 492  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 76: pp. 1456-1457, 1459; Fig. 76.3)  

The figure shows two- dimensional (apical four- chamber) and M- mode (mid- ventricular level) echocardiographic views demonstrating prominent late- systolic mitral valve prolapse (MVP). In part \(B\) of the figure, point C represents coaptation of the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets at the onset of systole. The posterior displacement (the U- shaped deformity) of the C- D segment represents prolapse of the leaflets into the left atrium in late systole.  

Using standardized echocardiographic criteria, the prevalence of MVP in the population is \(2.4\%\) . MVP is twice as common in women as in men, and there appears to be a strong hereditary component. The majority of affected people are asymptomatic, and moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is found in only \(10\%\) . For asymptomatic patients who do not have significant MR, reassurance is appropriate, with follow- up every few years, including repeat echocardiographic evaluation if there is a clinical change. For patients with advanced MR, more frequent (e.g., yearly) clinical and echocardiographic evaluations are recommended. Patients with MVP do not routinely require pre- dental antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis (see Answer to Question 464).  

The risk of sudden death in patients with MVP in the absence of significant MR is very low. Evaluation for arrhythmias is not warranted for asymptomatic patients but should be pursued in those with a history of sustained palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope. Cerebral embolic events have been reported to be more common in patients with MVP. However, a large case- controlled study showed no association between this disorder and ischemic neurologic events in patients younger than 45 years. The most common serious complication of MVP is progressive MR. Those at the highest risk are men and individuals older than 50 years.

These images reveal an ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD). Two- dimensional echocardiography, especially from the subcostal position, allows direct examination of the interatrial septum. Some types of ASDs, such as the sinus venosus defect, may be difficult to identify by transthoracic esophagography and can be more easily resolved by a transesophageal study. Both color flow Doppler and saline contrast echocardiography (part \(B\) ) may be used to evaluate the direction of flow across an ASD. In the uncomplicated situation, in which flow is directed predominantly from the left to the right atrium, left atrial (noncontrast) blood passes through the ASD and produces a negative contrast effect within the right atrium. Conversely, when Eisenmenger syndrome has developed, as in the case described, the shunt reverses (i.e., right- to- left direction), and contrast medium passes from the right atrium into the left- sided chambers after a peripheral vein saline injection. Anomalous pulmonary venous return (not demonstrated in this case) is most commonly associated with the sinus venosus type of ASD and is best visualized by transesophageal esophagography.

This M- mode panel displays high- frequency vibration of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve in diastole, which is characteristic of aortic regurgitation (AR). This sign is an echocardiographic correlate of the Austin Flint murmur, although, unlike the auscultatory finding, it may occur even in cases of mild AR.  

AR develops due to abnormalities of the aortic valve itself and/or because of dilatation of the aortic root. Primary aortic root pathology has become the most common cause of pure AR in the United States, reflecting the decline of rheumatic heart disease. AR due to dilatation of the ascending aorta is typically degenerative in origin (annuloaortic ectasia), and it may also be associated with specific disorders, including systemic hypertension, cystic medial necrosis of the aorta (isolated or in association with Marfan syndrome), giant cell arteritis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and syphilis. Causes of valvular AR include a bicuspid aortic valve, endocarditis, traumatic injury, and rheumatic aortic valve disease.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 495  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 75: p. 1445)  

The transmitral Doppler pattern is typical of mitral stenosis (MS). Echocardiography in a patient with MS provides a wealth of information about the presence and severity of the lesion. In patients with rheumatic MS (now an uncommon cause of MS in developed nations), typical findings include leaflet thickening, decreased leaflet separation in diastole, and anterior movement of the posterior mitral valve leaflet during early diastole. The chordae are variably thickened, fused, and shortened. In developed countries, nonrheumatic degenerative causes are more likely etiologies of MS, including extensive calcification of the mitral annulus in older individuals.  

In rheumatic MS, planimetry of the mitral orifice using two- dimensional echocardiography (parasternal shortaxis view), or three- dimensional echo imaging, can provide an accurate determination of the valve area. Doppler measurements are also very useful in quantifying the severity of MS. The peak velocity of transmitral flow is increased in MS, as in this case, and the rate of decline is reduced during early diastole. In the continuous- wave

<--- Page Split --->

Doppler flow velocity signal illustrated, the peak velocity exceeds \(2\mathrm{m / second}\) , yielding a peak transmitral gradient of greater than \(16\mathrm{mmHg}\) (per the modified Bernoulli equation, \(P = 4\mathrm{v}^2\) ), consistent with advanced MS. In addition, the valve area in rheumatic MS may be estimated using the Doppler pressure half- time method (see Answer to Question 26), which is based on the correlation between the size of the mitral orifice and the time required for peak pressure to reach half its initial level. This method is less accurate for calculating the valve area in patients with nonrheumatic MS. Finally, Doppler interrogation of the tricuspid regurgitant jet can estimate the pulmonary artery pressure, which is typically elevated in patients with significant MS.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 86: pp. 1630-1631)  

This case illustrates a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presenting with tuberculous pericarditis during the effusive stage of the illness. Whereas the incidence of tuberculous pericarditis has decreased in industrialized nations in recent decades, the disorder remains an important problem in immunosuppressed patients, including those with HIV disease. It is also a major cause of pericarditis among populations in developing regions, especially in sub- Saharan Africa. Among Africans with HIV infection, tuberculosis is the most common cause of pericardial disease.  

Tuberculous pericarditis usually manifests in the effusive stage, as in this case, or late in its course, following the development of constrictive pericarditis. The disease usually arises slowly and is marked by nonspecific systemic findings, including fever, night sweats, dyspnea, and fatigue. The acute onset of severe pericardial pain, which is seen frequently in viral or idiopathic pericarditis, is uncommon in tuberculous pericarditis. Abnormalities on physical examination may include fever, tachycardia, and a pericardial friction rub, as well as jugular venous distention, ascites, and hepatomegaly.  

The chest radiograph in this case displays common features of effusive tuberculous pericarditis. These include an enlarged cardiac silhouette with accompanying mediastinal widening suggestive of a pericardial effusion, normal lung hila and apices, and a small pleural effusion. Patients may also present with chronic constrictive pericarditis, with symptoms and signs consistent with severe systemic venous congestion. The diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis requires a high index of suspicion and is best confirmed by obtaining both pericardial fluid and a pericardial biopsy specimen during the early effusive stage. The measurement of a high level of adenosine deaminase activity \((>40\mathrm{U / L})\) is also supportive of the diagnosis, with a sensitivity of \(88\%\) and a specificity of \(83\%\) . In addition, polymerase chain reaction to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis from small amounts of fluid or pericardial tissue can sometimes accelerate the diagnosis. Without antituberculous therapy, the disease is fatal, with an early mortality greater than \(80\%\) . The effectiveness of corticosteroids in tuberculous pericarditis remains unclear, but some trials suggest that the addition of steroid therapy to standard antituberculous agents may shorten the time to resolution of symptoms.

The modified World Health Organization (WHO) classification for maternal cardiac risk categorizes cardiovascular diseases according to the threat to mothers during pregnancy. In this classification, pulmonary arterial hypertension, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular [LV] ejection fraction \(< 30\%\) or advanced heart failure symptoms), prior peripartum cardiomyopathy with residual LV dysfunction, severe mitral stenosis, severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, systemic right ventricle with at least moderate systolic dysfunction, and severe aortic dilation (including diameter \(>45\mathrm{mm}\) in Marfan syndrome) are among the conditions associated with maximal risk. In contrast, mitral valve prolapse and a low burden of premature ventricular beats do not increase maternal risk, while Turner syndrome without aortic dilation is associated with only a small incidence of maternal mortality.

D (Braunwald, Ch 76: p. 1460)The figure demonstrates mitral valve prolapse with posteriorly directed severe mitral regurgitation by color Doppler (the blue/yellow jet, representing a high- velocity aliasing signal, extends to the posterior left atrium and pulmonary veins). The optimal timing of mitral valve repair or replacement in patients with chronic asymptomatic severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is often a difficult clinical decision. The goal is to operate, even in asymptomatic individuals, before irreversible left ventricular (LV) dilatation and dysfunction have developed. If congestive heart failure or ventricular dysfunction supervenes, surgery should be performed as soon as possible to prevent further dysfunction. Thus, serial evaluation of the LV ejection fraction can be helpful in deciding when to intervene. The ejection fraction should be supranormal in patients with advanced MR. Once it falls below \(60\%\) , early systolic dysfunction is likely, and the risk of postoperative LV dysfunction increases. The LV end- systolic diameter (LVESD) is also helpful in timing surgical intervention. Patients should be referred for surgery before the LVESD exceeds \(40 \mathrm{mm}\) , to minimize the risk of postoperative LV dysfunction. Early pulmonary hypertension is considered a relative indication for mitral valve surgery, because patients with this complication, especially if it is accompanied by right ventricular dysfunction, have a worse prognosis. Although they may reduce the regurgitant fraction and improve forward cardiac output, neither angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors nor other vasodilators have been shown to delay the need for surgery or improve long- term outcomes in patients with chronic MR.  

Per current guidelines, class I indications for mitral valve surgery in chronic severe primary MR include symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients with evidence of LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction \(< 60\%\) and/or LVESD \(\geq 40 \mathrm{mm}\) ). Class IIa indications include asymptomatic patients with preserved LV function in whom there is a greater than \(95\%\) likelihood of successful repair.

## A (Braunwald, Ch 82: p. 1563; see also Answer to Question 481)  

This patient has tetralogy of Fallot, the components of which are (1) an outlet ventricular septal defect, (2) obstruction to right ventricular (RV) outflow, (3) overriding of the aorta, and (4) RV hypertrophy. In general, total correction of tetralogy of Fallot is advised for almost all patients, even in infancy. Successful early correction prevents the consequences of progressive infundibular obstruction and acquired pulmonary atresia, delayed growth and development, and the complications secondary to hypoxemia and polycythemia. The size of the pulmonary arteries is most important in determining candidacy for primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot, as opposed to the age or size of the infant or child. Marked hypoplasia of the pulmonary arteries is a relative contraindication to a total corrective operation. If this is present, a palliative procedure designed to increase pulmonary blood flow is generally recommended, such as balloon valvuloplasty of the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary arteries. Total correction of the tetralogy may then be carried out later in childhood or adolescence at lower risk.   

The postoperative period after palliative or corrective surgery is susceptible to several common complications. A sudden increase in pulmonary venous return may lead to left ventricular decompensation, whereas varying degrees of pulmonic valvular regurgitation may increase right ventricular cavity size. In addition, bleeding difficulties may be seen, especially in older polycythemic patients. Complete right bundle branch block or left anterior hemiblock is often observed postoperatively. The greatest cause of early and late mortality and poor surgical results is restriction of pulmonary arterial flow owing to persistent right- sided outflow tract obstruction. Most often, surgical repair leads to relief of symptoms of hypoxemia and severe exercise intolerance that mark the preoperative state.

The high- resolution contrast- enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) shows large thromboemboli in the right and left main pulmonary arteries (arrows in figure). High- resolution chest CT is the primary imaging test in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), as it offers a number of advantages over other modalities, including direct visualization of thrombus within the pulmonary arteries, the ability to concurrently identify thrombi in the proximal veins in the legs, and imaging of the lung parenchyma to identify alternative diagnoses. Whereas early CT scanners could image the proximal pulmonary arteries, current- generation multidetector devices allow high- resolution imaging of even subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Although invasive pulmonary angiography was historically the gold standard for the diagnosis of PE, contrast CT has assumed that role.  

Echocardiography is very helpful in risk stratification in patients with large PE. The presence of right ventricular dysfunction portends a higher risk of complications and may warrant consideration of more aggressive treatment such as fibrinolysis or catheter embolectomy.  

In patients with suspected PE, the identification of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities by venous

ultrasonography can provide circumstantial evidence of PE disease. The absence of DVT in such patients, however, does not exclude pulmonary embolism, because the majority of patients with PE do not have imaging evidence of DVT elsewhere.3

Each of the listed conditions results in elevated right- sided heart pressures. The diastolic "dip- and- plateau" pattern shown in the figure, also known as a "square root sign," is produced when early rapid diastolic inflow into the ventricle commences but is then abruptly halted by an opposing force. In the case of constrictive pericarditis, early diastolic inflow is terminated as ventricular filling reaches the volume limit imposed by the surrounding rigid pericardium. In restrictive cardiomyopathy, the myocardium is abnormally "stiff," and impaired relaxation accounts for a ventricular filling pattern that mimics pericardial constriction. Other conditions with similar right- sided hemodynamics as pericardial constriction include acute right ventricular infarction and massive pulmonary embolism. In these entities, filling of the acutely strained and dilated right ventricle is limited by an unprepared and relatively noncompliant pericardium.  

In cardiac tamponade, the elevated pericardial pressure equalizes the diastolic pressures of the cardiac chambers. Because even early diastolic ventricular filling is impaired (manifest by blunting of the \(y\) descent on right atrial tracing), there is no dip- and- plateau configuration.

Primary cardiac tumors are much less common than metastatic cardiac lesions. Approximately \(25\%\) of primary cardiac tumors display malignant characteristics, and up to \(75\%\) of these are sarcomas. Primary cardiac lymphomas are the next most common group. The sites of cardiac malignancies, in decreasing order of frequency, are the right atrium, the left atrium, the right ventricle, and the left ventricle.  

Tumors limited to the myocardium without intracavitary involvement may be asymptomatic or cause arrhythmias or conduction disturbances. Other typical  

presentations of cardiac malignancies include precordial pain, heart failure, pericardial effusion, tamponade, conduction system disorders, and/or vena caval obstruction. Tumors that involve the right- sided heart chambers may predominantly cause right- sided heart failure. The prognosis of cardiac malignancies is poor, with common survival times of a few weeks to 2 years after diagnosis. Historically, \(75\%\) of patients with cardiac sarcoma had evidence of distant metastases at the time of death, but more recent series have shown that only \(25\%\) to \(50\%\) of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, likely owing to earlier detection with improvements in noninvasive diagnostic capabilities.

## A (Braunwald, Ch 86: p. 1625)  

This patient has constrictive pericarditis (CP), etiologies of which include prior idiopathic or post- cardiac surgery pericarditis, previous mediastinal radiation therapy, and tuberculosis. Because of the progressive nature of this condition, the majority of patients become symptomatic and come to medical attention because of weakness, peripheral edema, and/or ascites. Scarring of the pericardium in CP is typically symmetric, such that filling of all heart chambers is impeded. While the pericardium in thickened in most patients with CP, approximately \(18\%\) have normal pericardial thickness on histopathologic examination. The treatment of constrictive pericarditis is complete resection of the pericardium, including excision from the anterior and inferior surfaces of the right ventricle and the diaphragmatic and anterolateral surfaces of the left ventricle. This procedure has been performed more successfully via median sternotomy than by left thoracotomy, because the former allows greater mobility of the heart. In recent series, the average operative mortality has ranged between \(2\%\) and \(20\%\) , with a correlation between the degree of the functional disability before the operation and survival after repair. Thus, it is generally recommended that patients undergo pericardiectomy soon after the development of symptoms. Between \(14\%\) and \(28\%\) of patients display a low- output syndrome in the immediate postoperative period, possibly related to rapid dilatation of the heart after release of the restraining pericardium.  

Predictors of late survival include preoperative New York Heart Association class, age, renal function, pulmonary artery pressure, and history of radiotherapy exposure to the heart. Symptomatic improvement occurs in approximately \(80\%\) of survivors of pericardiectomy, although the time course for such recovery varies. Some patients experience an immediate decrease in symptoms, whereas others may have a delayed or partial response that requires weeks or months for resolution of elevated jugular venous pressure and abnormal filling pressures. The 5- year postoperative survival is approximately \(75\%\) . Outcomes are worst in patients with radiation- induced constriction.

Lyme disease is a tickborne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Patients who contract this condition typically develop a rash (erythema chronicum migrans) at the site of the tick bite. Weeks to months later, if the condition is untreated, patients may develop complications involving the joints, central nervous system, and cardiovascular system. In early studies, up to \(10\%\) of untreated patients reportedly developed cardiac complications, but in the modern era with early use of antibiotics, Lyme carditis is rare (only \(1.1\%\) of patients with Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The most frequent cardiac manifestation is transient atrioventricular (AV) nodal block, including complete heart block. Although some patients require temporary pacing, AV block usually improves spontaneously, and a permanent pacemaker is rarely needed. Lyme disease can also result in myocarditis, which is usually mild and self- limited. Manifestations include nonspecific ST- segment and T- wave abnormalities on the ECG; only rarely do such patients develop symptoms of heart failure. The efficacy of antibiotics for Lyme carditis has not been established, although they are routinely prescribed.

The natural history of idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension was defined by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Registry of patients studied in the 1980s. In this registry, \(63\%\) of the patients were female, with a mean age of 36 years at the time of diagnosis. The most common initial symptoms were dyspnea \((80\%)\) , fatigue \((19\%)\) , syncope \((13\%)\) , and Raynaud phenomenon \((10\%)\) . Patients may describe chest pain, but it is not a very common symptom. In the NIH Registry the most common physical finding was a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound \((\mathrm{P}_2)\) . Tricuspid regurgitation was found in \(40\%\) , and peripheral edema in \(32\%\) . Eighty- seven percent of patients had electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy.  

The most common cause of death of patients in the NIH Registry was progressive right- sided heart failure \((47\%)\) . Sudden cardiac death occurred in \(26\%\) and was limited to patients with severe (class IV) symptoms.

## C (Braunwald, Ch72: pp. 1399-1404)  

The valve depicted is a calcified, stenotic aortic valve with three cusps. This is an acquired type of aortic stenosis (AS), and the thickened leaflets and nodular calcification are typical of the degenerative form seen in elderly patients. If the valve were bicuspid, it would reflect congenital AS. In degenerative calcific AS, chronic inflammation with lipid accumulation is evident, a process that may be similar to the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis. It is therefore salient that diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia (elevated low- density lipoprotein), smoking, and hypertension increase the risk of aortic valve calcification.  

The most likely murmur in this case would be crescendo- decrescendo during systole, loudest at the upper right sternal border and radiating toward the neck. Because apposition of the valve leaflets otherwise appears intact, it is unlikely that this individual has significant aortic regurgitation.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 508  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 86: p. 1628; Fig. 86.10)  

It is clinically important to differentiate constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Both conditions have similar hemodynamic findings during heart catheterization: the intracardiac diastolic pressures are elevated and the left and right ventricular pressure tracings usually demonstrate a "dip- and- plateau" configuration. There are, however, several hemodynamic features that can help differentiate these two entities. Because restrictive cardiomyopathy tends to cause some left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction as well as the diastolic abnormality, pulmonary hypertension and elevated right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure are frequently also present. Therefore, the ratio of RV systolic pressure to RV end- diastolic pressure (RVEDP) is usually greater than \(3\mathrm{mm}\) Hg, whereas in constrictive pericarditis it is typically less than \(3\mathrm{mm}\) Hg. Similarly, an RV systolic pressure greater than \(50\mathrm{mm}\) Hg is more consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy than with pericardial constriction.  

Close inspection of simultaneous RV and LV pressure tracings can also help discern which of these conditions is present. The pathophysiology of ventricular interdependence imposed by constrictive pericarditis leads to a discordance of LV and RV systolic pressures during respiration. That is, in contrast to the normal situation or in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, simultaneous LV and RV pressure measurements during inspiration in constriction show that RV systolic pressure rises as LV pressure falls. Furthermore, in constriction, the LV end- diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and RVEDP are equal, whereas in restriction, disproportionate LV involvement often causes the LVEDP to be more than \(5\mathrm{mm}\) Hg greater than the RVEDP. In restriction (but not constriction), an intravenous volume challenge in the cardiac catheterization laboratory can help accentuate this difference.

Other techniques are also used to distinguish constriction from restrictive cardiomyopathy. For example, chest computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging most often demonstrate a thickened pericardium in constriction, but not in restrictive disease. Also, if performed, a transvenous endomyocardial biopsy is usually normal in constriction but abnormal in myocardial restrictive disease.

Riociguat is a first- in- class therapy approved to improve exercise capacity and functional class in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (WHO group 4) who are inoperable, or who have persistent or recurrent symptoms after surgical treatment. It is also approved for use in patients with WHO group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension. Riociguat stimulates soluble guanylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate. The latter is a potent second messenger that results in vasorelaxation. Although nitric oxide is also a critical biological stimulator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, riociguat does not influence nitric oxide bioactivity.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 510  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 86: pp. 1622, 1625, 1630-1633)  

This patient has a malignant pericardial effusion. The most common tumors that invade the pericardium are, in order of decreasing frequency, lung, breast, and lymphoma. Malignant pericardial effusions may result from direct extension of tumor into the pericardium or from hematogenous or lymphatic spread. In patients who develop malignant pericardial effusions, the prognosis is poor; in a study of such patients, the mean survival was 15.1 weeks. After initial drainage of a large malignant pericardial effusion, a repeat echocardiographic study should be obtained within 72 hours to assess the rate of reaccumulation and to ensure the absence of tamponade physiology. If the fluid reaccumulates at a rapid rate, repeat pericardiocentesis followed by more aggressive therapy is warranted. Intrar pericardial instillation of a sclerosing agent, such as tetracycline, during catheter drainage has been advocated as a means of controlling recurrences, although complications such as fever, chest pain, and constriction may be troublesome, and prognosis of the underlying condition is not significantly improved by this technique. Surgical pericardiectomy is not usually advocated in this situation, because of the high operative mortality and the poor prognosis related to the underlying condition. Rather, more limited  

subxiphoid pericardidostomy ("pericardial window") or video- assisted thoracoscopic pericardiectomy is appropriate for symptomatic palliation.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 511  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 86: p. 1616; Fig.86.2)  

This patient has acute pericarditis, in which electrocardiographic alterations are diagnostically useful. Four stages of abnormalities of the ST segments and T waves can be distinguished. Stage I includes ST- segment elevation, in which the segment is concave upward; this elevation typically occurs in all leads except aVR and \(\mathrm{V}_1\) . The T waves during this stage are usually upright. PR- segment depression (or PR elevation in aVR) occurs in this stage in approximately 80% of patients. The return of ST segments to baseline, accompanied by T wave flattening, comprises stage II of this process. Stage III, which occurs in some but not all patients, is characterized by inversion of the T waves, such that the T wave vector is directed opposite to that of the ST segment. This should be contrasted to early inversion of the T wave in acute ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (in the absence of successful early reperfusion), which occurs before the return of ST segments to baseline. In those who develop T wave inversions, stage IV represents reversion of the T wave to normal and may not occur for weeks to months after the acute event.  

Whereas all four stages are detected in approximately half of patients with acute pericarditis, approximately 90% of patients will demonstrate some of these electrocardiographic abnormalities that allow characterization of an acute chest pain episode as pericarditis.  

Stage I changes of pericarditis can be differentiated from the electrocardiographic presentation of early repolarization. An ST- segment/T wave ratio greater than 0.25 in lead \(\mathrm{V}_6\) is more consistent with acute pericarditis, whereas a ratio less than 0.25 is more suggestive of early repolarization.

The most serious symptoms of aortic stenosis (AS) in adults are angina pectoris, syncope, and heart failure. When symptoms become manifest, the prognosis for untreated AS is poor. Natural history survival studies show that the interval from the onset of symptoms to the time

of death is approximately 5 years in patients with angina, 3 years in those with syncope, and 2 years in patients with heart failure (Fig. 4.38). Angina is present in approximately two- thirds of patients with critical AS, even in the absence of coronary artery disease, resulting from the combination of increased oxygen demand and the reduction of oxygen delivery.  

Syncope in AS occurs most commonly during or after exertion. It is related to reduced cerebral perfusion caused by systemic vasodilatation during exercise in the presence of a fixed cardiac output. Sudden death occurs with increased frequency in patients with critical AS, but almost invariably in those who have had previous symptoms.  

Symptoms of AS may become exacerbated by the development of atrial fibrillation. Because of the decreased diastolic compliance of the hypertrophied ventricle, patients with AS are highly dependent on atrial contraction to deliver preload and maintain cardiac output. Thus, when atrial fibrillation develops, significant hemodynamic deterioration may follow.

This patient has severe pulmonary hypertension with systemic hypotension. Using the provided data, the patient's cardiac output ([mean pulmonary artery pressure - mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure]/pulmonary vascular resistance) is \(3.1\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{minute}\) , and the cardiac index (= cardiac output/body surface area) is reduced at \(2.0\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{minute} / \mathrm{m}^2\) consistent with cardiogenic shock. Current guidelines recommend initiation of intravenous prostacyclin in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and cardiogenic shock. Although macitentan, a nonselective endothelin receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, no data are currently available for use of this therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock. The other two options (tPA and digoxin) would not be appropriate for this clinical scenario.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 514  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 86: p. 1620; Fig. 86.3)  

Penetrating cardiac trauma is most commonly due to stab wounds and gunshot injuries. The consequences of such injury depend on the nature of the penetrating object, the size of the wound, the entering location, and the structures that are impacted. The site of cardiac injury can be predicted by the location of entry on the chest wall. Because of its anterior location, the right ventricle is at greatest risk of penetrating chest trauma. Of note, survival is higher in patients who suffer penetrating injuries to the ventricles than to the atria, because the former are thicker- walled structures more likely to seal the laceration site.  

Patients who suffer penetrating injuries to the chest wall are at high risk of cardiac tamponade because of bleeding into the pericardial sac. If this complication develops, patients usually have muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distention, and hypotension with a narrowed pulse pressure; pulsus paradoxus is often present. Many trauma surgeons discourage pericardiocentesis for suspected tamponade after acute trauma because clots form quickly and often cannot be drained successfully through a needle, and a negative pericardiocentesis does not rule out tamponade. Furthermore, if there is continued bleeding from cardiac perforation, any beneficial effect of pericardiocentesis would be short- lived. Therefore, patients with penetrating chest injuries, significant bleeding, and a clinical picture that raises concern of tamponade should proceed directly to thoracotomy. Rupture of the interventricular septum has been described as a potential late complication in patients who have experienced penetrating chest trauma.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 515  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 82: p. 1559; Table 82.9)  

The presentation of persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in adults depends on the degree of left- to- right shunting. Small silent shunts (i.e., those without murmurs) are almost always asymptomatic and are incidental findings during echocardiography. The risk of endarteritis is negligible in such patients. However, small audible shunts may occasionally present because of a superimposed endovascular infection.

<--- Page Split --->

Moderate shunts impose a volume load on the left ventricle and left atrium, resulting in left ventricular dysfunction and atrial fibrillation. Such patients typically present with either dyspnea or palpitations. On physical examination, a loud continuous "machinery" murmur is best appreciated in the first or second left intercostal space. The pulse pressure is usually wide owing to aortic diastolic runoff into the pulmonary trunk.  

Large shunts initially cause left- sided volume overload, but subsequently lead to irreversible pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger physiology. Chest radiology at that stage reveals enlarged central pulmonary arteries with peripheral pruning. Closure of a clinically detectable PDA is recommended, except when it is accompanied by irreversible pulmonary hypertension. Trials of the Amplatzer occluder device indicates that transcatheter closure can achieve a success rate of at least \(98.1\%\) for complete ductal closure over long- term follow- up.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 52: pp. 1031, 1032; Table 52.1)  

Chronic heavy consumption of alcohol is associated with systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction, systemic hypertension, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. The likelihood of developing alcohol- induced dilated cardiomyopathy correlates with the amount of alcohol consumed over a lifetime. Most men with this condition have consumed more than \(90 \mathrm{g}\) of ethanol daily for over 5 years. Women appear to be more susceptible to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy at the same level of alcohol consumption as men. With abstinence from alcohol, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function typically improve, often dramatically. Most of the improvement occurs in the first 6 months of abstinence, but systolic function may continue to normalize over a more prolonged time. The prognosis of patients who continue to drink heavily is poor.  

Alcohol consumption at moderate levels in those without known coronary artery disease is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, including a lower incidence of sudden death.

Amyloidosis can afflict the cardiovascular system in several ways. Restrictive cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction is the most common presentation and is due to myocardial infiltration by amyloid protein. In this situation, right- sided heart failure symptoms often predominate, with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, and elevated jugular venous pressure. A second common presentation is biventricular heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. In some patients, congestive symptoms may be exacerbated by amyloid deposition in the atria with loss of effective atrial transport, despite the presence of sinus rhythm. Orthostatic hypotension occurs in \(10\%\) of patients with amyloidosis and results from infiltration of the autonomic nervous system. Other cardiovascular presentations include rhythm disturbances (especially atrial fibrillation) and conduction system disease. The ECG typically demonstrates low limb lead voltage. Small pericardial effusions are often observed by echocardiography in cardiac amyloidosis; however, significant pericardial disease is rare and cardiac tamponade and pericardial constriction are not typical complications.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 518  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 80: p. 1526; Tables 80.3 and 80.4)  

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most aggressive organisms responsible for infective endocarditis, and infection with this bacterium results in rapid destruction of heart valves and surrounding tissues. S. aureus has a propensity to cause metastatic infections, including in the central nervous system, which is affected in \(30\%\) to \(50\%\) of patients. Central nervous complications include cerebral embolism, meningitis, and cerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of mycotic aneurysms. Patients with right- sided endocarditis (i.e., tricuspid valve involvement) due to S. aureus have a better prognosis than those with left- sided infections.  

Because S. aureus endocarditis is so destructive, it requires prompt and aggressive therapy. Although some experts have advocated early surgical intervention for native valve endocarditis due to this organism, there is a risk of infecting the new prosthetic valve if surgery is performed before adequate sterilization of the blood. Therefore, initial aggressive antibiotic therapy should be undertaken, with surgery reserved for those who fail to respond or for those who develop complications such as intractable heart failure. In contrast, prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by S. aureus carries an extremely high mortality rate, approaching \(50\%\) in patients treated medically, and early surgical therapy is generally recommended.  

Methicillin- resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of both nosocomial and community- acquired infections, such that empiric therapy for suspected S. aureus endocarditis should begin with an agent that is effective against MRSA, such as vancomycin.

Patients with pulmonary hypertension (i.e., mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP] greater than \(20\mathrm{mm}\) Hg measured at right heart catheterization) can be divided into three cardiopulmonary hemodynamic profiles. In those with isolated precapillary pulmonary hypertension, the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is greater than \(3.0\mathrm{Wood}\) units, and the pulmonary artery wedge pressure is \(15\mathrm{mm}\) Hg or less. Isolated postcapillary pulmonary hypertension is defined by PVR less than \(3.0\mathrm{Wood}\) units and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) greater than \(15\mathrm{mm}\) Hg. In distinction, combined pre- and postcapillary pulmonary hypertension is present in patients with mPAP greater than \(20\mathrm{mm}\) Hg when the PVR is greater than \(3.0\mathrm{Wood}\) units and PAWP greater than \(15\mathrm{mm}\) Hg. Identifying the hemodynamic profile of an individual patient allows consideration of potential etiologies of pulmonary hypertension, thereby directing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 520  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 52: p. 1049)  

Löffler endocarditis is a syndrome associated with eosinophilia that occurs in temperate climates. The typical patient with this condition is a male in his fourth decade with a persistent eosinophilia count greater than \(1500 / \mathrm{mm}^3\) for at least 6 months and evidence of organ involvement. Cardiac manifestations are present in approximately \(75\%\) of patients. The eosinophilia may be reactive (e.g., associated with an allergic or parasitic disorder), associated with leukemia, or of no apparent cause. The combination of hypereosinophilia and cardiac involvement is also part of the Churg- Strauss syndrome, which can be differentiated from Löffler endocarditis by the coexisting presence of asthma, nasal polyposis, and necrotizing vasculitis.  

The pathology of Löffler endocarditis involves mural endocardial thickening of the inflow and apical portions of both ventricles. Histologic findings include (1) an acute inflammatory eosinophilic myocarditis, (2) thrombosis and inflammation of intramural coronary vessels, (3) mural thrombosis, and (4) fibrotic thickening of the ventricular wall.  

Clinically, patients present with weight loss, fever, cough, rash, and heart failure. Cardiomegaly is present early in the course, and the murmur of mitral regurgitation is common. Systemic embolism occurs frequently and may lead to neurologic and renal dysfunction.  

Laboratory findings include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and an increased eosinophil count. Imaging frequently demonstrates localized thickening of the posterobasal left ventricular wall with absent or reduced motion of the mitral posterior leaflet by echocardiography. The apex may contain thrombus. Systolic ventricular function is usually normal. The hemodynamic consequences of the dense endocardial scarring are those of a restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) with abnormal diastolic filling. Findings at cardiac catheterization are consistent with RCM, including elevated ventricular filling pressures with an early diastolic "dip- and- plateau" configuration.   

Medical treatment of Löffler endocarditis is moderately effective. Administration of steroids and hydroxyurea can improve survival.

The figure demonstrates a midsystolic notch in the right ventricular outflow tract Doppler velocity profile, which is indicative of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Notching occurs due to a reflective fluid wave from the pulmonary vascular bed toward the right ventricle and is a consequence of decreased pulmonary vascular compliance. It occurs more commonly in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary vascular disease (e.g., group I pulmonary hypertension) than in patients with pulmonary hypertension on the basis of left heart failure.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 75: pp. 1441, 1445)  

This woman has rheumatic heart disease. She has mitral stenosis (MS) based on the loud \(\mathrm{S_1}\) and apical opening snap. Many patients with advanced MS have an early blowing diastolic murmur along the left sternal border and a normal systemic pulse pressure. In the majority of such patients, the murmur is due to mild aortic regurgitation (AR) and it is usually of little clinical importance. However, approximately \(10\%\) of patients with MS have severe rheumatic AR. This can usually be recognized by peripheral signs of AR, such as a widened pulse pressure and signs of left ventricular (LV) enlargement by ECG and chest radiograph, with confirmation by echocardiography.  

In patients with multivulvar disease, a proximal valve lesion may mask the presence of a more distal abnormality. Thus, significant AR may not be easily auscultated in patients with severe MS. The widened pulse pressure, in particular, may be absent in the presence of severe MS. Furthermore, the apical diastolic Austin Flint murmur associated with AR may be mistaken for the rumbling murmur of MS. These two murmurs may be distinguished during auscultation by means of bedside maneuvers. Isometric handgrip and squatting augment the diastolic murmur of AR (and the associated Austin Flint murmur) but have little effect on the murmur of MS. In this patient, the response

<--- Page Split --->

to handgrip is consistent with the presence of an Austin Flint murmur.  

The fact that the ECG of this patient shows LV hypertrophy in addition to left atrial enlargement is inconsistent with simple MS and suggests that the degree of superimposed AR is significant. There is no evidence on examination of tricuspid stenosis or mitral regurgitation. Pulmonic regurgitation due to pulmonary hypertension in patients with MS can also cause an early diastolic murmur along the left sternal border. However, such a murmur would be associated with a loud pulmonic component of \(S_{2}\) and would not intensify with handgrip.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 75: p. 1452)  

Diuretic therapy and negative chronotropic agents are the mainstays of medical therapy for patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis (MS). The high left atrial pressure in this condition elevates pulmonary venous pressure, resulting in dyspnea due to transfusion of fluid into the alveolar spaces and stimulation of pulmonary J fibers. Diuretics reduce intravascular volume and left atrial pressure and therefore improve dyspnea. Maintaining a controlled, relatively slow heart rate prolongs diastole, maximizes the time for left atrial emptying, and reduces left atrial pressure. Thus, negative chronotropic agents such as beta blockers improve exercise capacity in MS patients, even in individuals in sinus rhythm.  

Because left ventricular contractile function is normal in pure MS, digitalis glycosides have no beneficial hemodynamic effect and are useful only as agents for ventricular rate control if atrial fibrillation supervenes, though beta blockers are preferred for this purpose.  

As reviewed in the Answer to Question 464, endocarditis prophylaxis before dental procedures is not recommended for native valve abnormalities such as MS.

Most cases of infectious acute pericarditis are caused by a virus, most commonly the enteroviruses (e.g., coxsackieviruses, echovirus) and adenovirus. In contrast, the incidence of nontuberculous bacterial pericarditis is low, approximately \(5\%\) of cases, and it develops most often as a complication of pneumonia, mediastinitis, or infective endocarditis. The most frequently involved bacterial organisms are streptococcal and staphylococcal species. The overall survival in bacterial pericarditis is poor, averaging \(30\%\) .  

Tuberculosis was once the leading cause of constrictive pericarditis worldwide. However, the incidence of this condition is now rare in developed nations, and it is encountered mostly in immunocompromised hosts and in developing societies.  

Pericarditis associated with fungal disease is most often caused by Histoplasma. It occurs in otherwise healthy young individuals and is thought to be a noninfectious inflammatory effusion secondary to fungal infection in nearby mediastinal lymph nodes. This process should be considered in patients with suspected pericarditis who live where the fungus is endemic—the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys. It is generally a self- limited disease, and treatment typically consists of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory agents without antifungal therapy. The latter is necessary only when there is evidence of disseminated histoplasmosis.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 55: p0105; eFig. 55.1)  

Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. It is prevalent in Central and South America, where 8 to 10 million people are infected. The disease is characterized by three phases: acute, latent, and chronic. During the acute phase, the disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of a redivuid bug, commonly called the kissing bug. After inoculation, protozoa multiply and migrate widely through the body. Clinical manifestations during the acute phase may include fever, muscle pains, hepatosplenomegaly, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis. The disease then enters an asymptomatic latent phase for many years. Typically, chronic cardiac manifestations become evident 5 to 15 years after the initial infection. Approximately \(30\%\) of infected individuals develop symptoms of chronic Chagas disease; many individuals with high parasite burdens do not. There is poor correlation between the level of parasitemia and the severity of disease later.  

The major cardiovascular findings of the chronic phase of Chagas disease include myocardial fibrosis, conduction system abnormalities, ventricular dilation (dilated cardiomyopathy), and apical aneurysm formation. Associated clinical manifestations include progressive heart failure (predominantly right sided), arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and possible thromboembolism. The most common electrocardiographic abnormalities are right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block; atrioventricular block occurs less frequently. Ventricular arrhythmias are common.  

The diagnosis of Chagas disease is confirmed using a complement- fixation test (Machado- Guerreiro test). Antitrypanosomal therapy should be administered to patients with acute disease, those with positive serologies without symptoms of chronic disease, and those with early cardiac involvement. Such therapy is not effective in reversing pathologic changes and complications in those with advanced chronic Chagas cardiac disease; standard heart failure and antiarrhythmic treatments should be undertaken instead.

The echocardiogram demonstrates prominent echogenicity along both surfaces of the interatrial septum (arrow in Fig. 4.39), consistent with normal deployment of a transcatheter atrial septal defect (ASD) closure device. Indications for this method are the same as for surgical closure of an ASD, but strict structural criteria must be met. Successful closure can be accomplished in the majority of patients, and complications, such as device embolization or atrial perforation, are rare.  

Atrial myxomas are the most common primary heart tumor. When attached to the interatrial septum, echocardiography most commonly demonstrates a mobile mass attached to the limbus of the fossa ovalis by a stalk. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum occurs most often in obese, elderly female patients. It represents a prominent fatty deposition at the interatrial septum that spares the fossa ovalis, creating a thick "dumbbell" appearance on echocardiography. This condition is associated with a high incidence of atrial arrhythmias. In cardiac amyloidosis, infiltration causes increased thickness of all cardiac chamber walls, not just the interatrial septum.

leaflet (arrow in Fig. 4.40). There is accompanying left atrial enlargement. The transmittal spectral Doppler shows an increased early diastolic velocity with a slowed diastolic descent, indicative of a diastolic pressure gradient across the valve due to mitral stenosis (MS).  

Only approximately \(15\%\) of patients with isolated MS experience anginal- type chest discomfort. This symptom may arise from right ventricular hypertension, concomitant atherosclerosis, or coronary obstruction due to embolization of left atrial thrombus.  

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with MS, and the prevalence increases with age. It tends to be poorly tolerated because of the lack of effective atrial contribution to left ventricular filling and the shortened diastolic filling time in patients with rapid ventricular rates. AF also predisposes to atrial thrombus formation and embolization. The risk of systemic embolism in MS correlates directly with patient age and left atrial size and inversely with cardiac output.  

Infective endocarditis in MS tends to be more common in patients with milder forms of the disease, occurring less frequently on very thickened and calcified mitral valves.

A (Braunwald, Ch 82: p.1559)These findings are consistent with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). In the majority of preterm infants weighing less than \(1500 \mathrm{g}\) , the ductus arteriosus remains patent for a prolonged period, and in approximately one- third of those infants, a large shunt leads to significant cardiopulmonary deterioration. Noninvasive evaluation may reveal evidence of significant shunting before the appearance of physical findings of ductal patency. Physical examination may reveal bounding peripheral pulses, an infraclavicular and inter- scapular systolic murmur (sometimes heard as a continuous murmur), a hyperactive precordium, hepatomegaly,

and recurrent episodes of apnea and bradycardia. An increase in the cardiothoracic ratio is seen on sequential chest radiographs and may be accompanied by increased pulmonary arterial markings, perihilar edema, and ultimately generalized pulmonary edema. Echocardiography may demonstrate increased left ventricular end-diastolic and left atrial dimensions, and color Doppler confirms the presence of left- to- right shunting.  

Management of the premature infant with a PDA depends on the clinical presentation of the disorder. In an asymptomatic infant, intervention is usually unnecessary, because the PDA will almost always undergo spontaneous closure and will not require surgical ligation and division. Infants with respiratory distress syndrome and signs of a significant ductal shunt usually are unresponsive to medical measures to control congestive heart failure and require closure of the PDA for survival. This is usually accomplished pharmacologically with indomethacin to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and achieve constriction and closure. For infants unresponsive to indomethacin, surgical ligation may be considered.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 529  

## A (Braunwald, Ch. 54: pp. 1063-1065)  

The echocardiogram demonstrates hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with asymmetric septal hypertrophy. The most common physiologic abnormality in HCM is diastolic dysfunction, characterized by abnormal stiffness of the left ventricle, which results in impaired diastolic filling. The abnormal diastolic relaxation increases the left ventricular (LV) end- diastolic pressure with accompanying elevations of left atrial, pulmonary venous, and pulmonary capillary pressures. Most patients have a normal, or even supranormal, LV ejection fraction.  

Although the generation of a pressure gradient due to associated subaortic obstruction might suggest that LV ejection is slowed or impeded during systole, there is actually rapid ventricular emptying. Hemodynamic studies have confirmed that the majority of LV output is unusually rapid in patients with HCM and is completed earlier in systole than normal, regardless of whether an outflow gradient is present. Thus, the common symptom of dyspnea in this condition is largely due to impaired diastolic relaxation rather than compromised systolic ejection. Although there is a strong temporal and quantitative relationship between mitral valve systolic anterior motion and subaortic obstruction, symptoms do not reliably correlate with the magnitude of the generated outflow gradient. Furthermore, there can be significant variation over time in both the extent of the obstruction (and associated murmur) and the patient's symptoms.  

Exertional syncope and angina occur in some patients with HCM, and these symptoms are likely related, at least in part, to systolic subaortic obstruction.  

The echolucent space posterior to the left ventricle in the echocardiogram represents a tiny pericardial effusion.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 530  

## D (Braunwald, Ch. 73: p1428)  

Acute aortic regurgitation (AR) is most often caused by infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, or trauma. Many of the physical findings typical of chronic AR are not present in patients with acute AR. In acute AR, the left ventricle has not dilated and is relatively noncompliant, such that its early diastolic pressure rises rapidly. If the resulting left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure exceeds the left atrial pressure, the mitral valve may close prematurely and can produce diastolic mitral regurgitation. Because the elevated LV diastolic pressure blunts runoff of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle, the aortic diastolic pressure does not decline as substantially as in chronic AR. Therefore, the pulse pressure does not widen significantly, and physical findings typical of an increased pulse pressure, such as Corrigan pulse (abrupt upstroke, then quick collapse of the arterial pulse), are absent. Similarly, the duration of the diastolic murmur is shorter in acute AR than in chronic AR.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital cardiac defect that presents after the newborn period. Most experts advocate surgical repair in the first 6 months of life to avoid chronic cyanosis and its complications. Initial operative outcomes are excellent provided that the ventricular septal defect is adequately closed and right ventricular (RV) outflow tract obstruction is relieved. However, many patients develop progressive pulmonary regurgitation, especially when a transannular patch is used to enlarge the RV outflow tract. The optimal timing to correct this complication with pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) remains uncertain, but it is appreciated that PVR should be performed when there is severe pulmonary regurgitation with substantial RV dilation or dysfunction, even in the absence of subjective dyspnea. In fact, adults with congenital heart disease tend to underestimate their exercise intolerance, underscoring the importance of objective measures of exercise capacity, such as cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

<--- Page Split --->

Patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot are at increased risk of sudden death (SD). Although criteria for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention remain controversial, a QRS width greater than 180 milliseconds and left ventricular dysfunction have been identified as risk factors for SD. Atrial arrhythmias are also common in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot; risk factors include left atrial dilation and tricuspid regurgitation.  

The American Heart Association guideline for the prevention of endocarditis recommends preclinical antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects at the site of, or adjacent to, prosthetic material (e.g., Dacron patch).

## B (Braunwald, Ch 88: p. 1662)  

The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) arises from several factors including pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by alveolar hypoxemia, acidemia, the mechanical effects of high lung volumes on the pulmonary vessels, and small- vessel loss in regions of emphysema. Right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and dilatation may develop over time (Fig. 4.41).  

A series of trials in the 1980s established that, in patients with COPD and PH who are hypoxemic at rest \(\mathrm{(PaO_2< 60}\) mm Hg), long- term oxygen therapy prevented progressive increases in mean pulmonary artery pressure, and continuous oxygen supplementation was more effective than nocturnal supplementation alone. A more recent study did not find benefit of long- term oxygen therapy on survival or hospitalizations in patients with only moderate oxygen

desaturation at rest \(\mathrm{(SpO_2 89\% - 93\%)}\) or with exercise \(\mathrm{(SpO_2}\) \(< 90\%\) for \(\geq 10\) seconds).  

Although digoxin may improve the RV ejection fraction in some patients with RV dilation and dysfunction, it can also contribute to adverse pulmonary vasoconstriction and has not been shown to have a beneficial effect on survival. Furthermore, digitalis toxicity may be precipitated by the hypoxemia and acidemia often associated with COPD. Studies of PH- targeted therapy in patients with COPD and PH have yielded mixed results, and there is no definitive evidence that theophylline, beta- agonists, hydralazine, or other pulmonary vasodilators (e.g., phosphodiesterase inhibitors or endothelin receptor antagonists) improve symptoms or survival in these patients.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 533  

## B (Braunwald, Ch. 82: p. 1575)  

Coarctation of the aorta (Fig. 4.42) occurs two to five times more commonly in males than in females. Most infants and children with coarctation are asymptomatic. Coarctations discovered in the adult are frequently associated with additional abnormalities, including bicuspid aortic valve \((50\% - 85\%)\) and intracranial aneurysms.  

Significant coarctation places a pressure load on the left ventricle (LV), which leads to LV hypertrophy and ultimately heart failure. On physical examination, findings include a differential systolic blood pressure (brachial artery pressure greater than popliteal artery pressure by \(>10 \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}\) ) and radial- femoral pulse delay.  

The mean survival time of patients with uncorrected coarctation is 35 years. Heart failure is the most common cause of death in adults, followed by endocarditis, intracranial hemorrhage, and aortic dissection. Surgical repair is associated with low mortality. Outcomes are most influenced by the presence of other congenital anomalies or more complex variants of aortic coarctation involving the aortic arch. Prior hypertension resolves in up to \(50\%\) of patients, but it may recur later in life.

helpful in differentiating between left atrial thrombus and myxoma. Thrombus usually produces a layered appearance and tends to localize to the more posterior segments of the atrium. In contrast, left atrial myxoma is often mottled in appearance and typically attaches along the limbus of the fossa ovalis of the interatrial septum. In some atrial myxomas, including the one demonstrated here, echolucent areas are seen within the tumor mass that correspond pathologically to regions of hemorrhage.  

Most cardiac myxomas arise in the left atrium. Less commonly they may be found in the right atrium, in both atria, or in one of the ventricles. Signs and symptoms of left atrial myxoma are similar to those of mitral valve disease, owing to interference of the mass with normal mitral valvular function. Physical examination may demonstrate pulmonary congestion and an intensified \(\mathrm{S_1}\) . An early diastolic sound (tumor "plop") may be present, although this is often positional. Cardiac myxomas may also produce a variety of constitutional symptoms and extracardiac findings, including fever, malaise, weight loss, and arthralgias. These symptoms have been attributed to the tumor's production of interleukin- 6. Several abnormal laboratory findings may be present, including an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, polycythemia, leukocytosis, and anemia.  

Approximately \(10\%\) of cardiac myxomas are familial. In such cases, patients typically present at a younger age and are more likely to have multiple additional myxomas in noncardiac locations. Carney complex is inherited as an autosomal dominant syndrome consisting of cardiac myxomas, along with dermatologic (hyperpigmented skin lesions) and endocrine abnormalities (adrenal, pituitary, testicular).  

The treatment of symptomatic cardiac myxoma is prompt surgical resection of the tumor. Recurrences appear in approximately \(3\%\) of patients, with a higher incidence in those with familial myxomas.

The diagnostic approach for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) involves careful clinical assessment in conjunction with judicious diagnostic testing (Fig. 4.43). The most

<--- Page Split --->
![](images/273_0.jpg)

<center>FIG. 4.43 CT, Computed tomography; CXR, chest x-ray; PE, pulmonary embolism. </center>  

common symptoms of PE are dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. Physical examination may be unremarkable, or findings may include tachycardia, tachypnea, and increased intensity of the pulmonic component of \(S_{2}\) . Clinical probability of PE can be assessed using the Wells criteria as either high or not high (see Braunwald, Chapter 87, Table 87.4).  

When the clinical probability of PE is not high, a normal plasma D- dimer assay usually suffices to rule out PE. The D- dimer assay is highly sensitive for the presence of PE but has low specificity because elevations also occur in sepsis, recent surgery or trauma, malignancies, and other systemic illnesses. A normal D- dimer assay therefore has excellent negative predictive value in patients who do not have high clinical probability.  

When the clinical probability of PE is high, chest computed tomographic (CT) angiography is the superior imaging modality. This technique has the capability to visualize even subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Isolated contrasted is required for this test, and a history of anaphylaxis to iodinated contrast is an absolute contraindication. Renal disease and pregnancy are relative contraindications: depending on the clinical context, the benefit of obtaining CT angiography in these situations may outweigh the risks.  

In patients with large PE, electrocardiographic signs of right- sided heart strain may be present (including ST- segment and T wave abnormalities in the right precordial leads \([\mathrm{V}_1 - \mathrm{V}_4]\) , right- axis deviation, new right bundle branch block, and an \(\mathrm{S}_1\mathrm{Q}_3\mathrm{T}_3\) pattern), but such findings are generally absent when small PEs are present. The most common electrocardiographic abnormality in PE is simply sinus tachycardia, and a normal ECG does not exclude PE.  

Arterial blood gas analysis is generally not helpful in the diagnosis of PE. Due to the reserve of gas exchange capacity in the lungs, PEs must be large to cause hypoxemia, such that a normal \(\mathrm{PaO}_2\) does not exclude a small- to- moderate PE.  

Ventilation- perfusion lung scanning results are often ambiguous. Although PE is very unlikely to be present with a completely normal scan, and very likely when the test is "high probability," scans frequently fall between these two extremes ("intermediate probability") and do not provide definitive results. This test is now useful for diagnosis of acute PE only when CT angiography is contraindicated.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 536  

## D (Braunwald, Ch. 98: p. 1829)  

Primary tumors of the heart are rare (autopsy incidence \(0.001\% - 0.03\%\) ), with benign tumors representing more than \(80\%\) . The majority of benign cardiac tumors are myxomas, followed in frequency by lipomas, papillary fibro- elastomas, rhabdomyomas, and fibromas. Among the malignant tumors, the most common are sarcomas, and, of these, angiosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma are the most frequent forms.  

Although it can be difficult to differentiate benign from malignant tumors clinically, certain findings may be helpful. The presence of distant metastases, local mediastinal invasion, evidence of rapid growth in tumor size, hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, precordial pain, location of the tumor on the right as opposed to the left side of the heart, and extension into the pulmonary veins are all suggestive of a malignant rather than a benign tumor. Furthermore, infiltration of the myocardium is more indicative of a malignant process. Benign tumors are more likely to occur on the left side of the interatrial septum and to grow slowly.  

Cardiac symptoms caused by tumors are primarily determined by mechanical interferences. Myxomas that are located on the left side may produce mitral valve symptoms, whereas right- sided malignant tumors may produce signs of right- sided failure.

## C (Braunwald, Ch. 86: p. 1620)  

Echocardiography is very useful to evaluate for cardiac tamponade. Findings most suggestive of tamponade physiology include (1) a large pericardial effusion, (2) right atrial (RA) and right ventricular (RV) diastolic compression/collapse, (3) an exaggerated inspiratory increase in

<--- Page Split --->

transtruncispid flow velocities with concurrent decrease in transmital flow velocities, and (4) inferior vena caval dilatation with absence of normal inspiratory collapse.  

RV diastolic collapse has higher sensitivity and specificity than pulsus paradoxus for increased pericardial pressure. RV diastolic collapse is also more specific than RA compression in the diagnosis of tamponade. However, diastolic RV collapse may not be evident in patients with pulmonary hypertension who develop tamponade, because right- sided diastolic pressures are higher than normal.  

A small pericardial effusion makes tamponade less likely, but does not exclude the diagnosis, especially if the pericardial fluid has accumulated rapidly. In addition, small pericardial effusions can be associated with "low- pressure" tamponade in patients with intravascular volume depletion. Small localized pericardial effusions (e.g., after cardiac surgery or trauma) can also result in tamponade because of localized chamber compression.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 538  

## C (Braunwald, Ch. 86: p. 1628; Table 86.7)  

The lateral chest radiograph shows calcification of the pericardium, suggestive of constrictive pericarditis (CP). In this patient's case, prior radiation therapy is the likely cause of constriction.  

The clinical presentation of patients with chronic CP is predominantly that of right- sided heart failure. In early stages, signs include jugular venous distention (with a rapid \(y\) descent) and Kussmaul sign (inspiratory augmentation of the jugular venous pressure, instead of the normal decline), peripheral edema, and abdominal discomfort due to passive hepatic congestion. As the disease progresses, ascites, jaundice, and anasarca may ensue. Some patients with advanced CP have a pericardial knock, an early diastolic sound heard best at the left sternal border or apex that corresponds to the sudden cessation of ventricular filling imposed by the rigid, constricting pericardium. The pericardial knock occurs earlier and is of higher frequency than an \(\mathrm{S}_3\) gallop sound and may be confused with the opening snap of mitral stenosis (MS), but is not followed by the diastolic murmur of MS.  

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (CMP) may have a similar clinical presentation as CP, and prior chest radiation is risk factor for both conditions. Hemodynamic measurements in patients with either CP or restrictive CMP are typically notable for elevation of ventricular diastolic pressures and a diastolic "dip- and- plateau" configuration of the pressure tracings (also called the "square root sign").  

One way to distinguish CP from restrictive CMP during cardiac catheterization is to observe the variation in simultaneously recorded systolic right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) systolic pressures. In CP, there is usually a striking discordance between these pressures during inspiration: LV filling decreases while RV filling increases, resulting in lower LV systolic pressure with a simultaneous increase in RV systolic pressure. This finding reflects the exaggerated ventricular interdependence that results from pericardial constraint. In contrast, in patients with restrictive CMP, LV systolic pressure and RV systolic pressure decrease concordantly during inspiration.

## C (Braunwald, Ch. 72: p. 1399; Fig. 72.1)  

The three primary causes of valvular aortic stenosis (AS) are (1) a congenitally bicuspid valve that becomes calcified, (2) calcification of a structurally normal trileaflet valve, and (3) rheumatic disease (Fig. 4.44). A bicuspid valve is present in more than \(50\%\) of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis (two- thirds of those \(< 70\) years of age and \(40\%\) of those \(>70\) years). Calcification of a congenitally bicuspid, or normal trileaflet, valve is the most common cause of AS in adults in the United States. Although calcific aortic valve disease was once considered to result from years of mechanical stress on the valve, it appears to represent proliferative and inflammatory changes, with lipid accumulation and infiltration of macrophages and T lymphocytes, in a manner similar to vascular calcification. As in atherosclerosis, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are risk factors for the development of this valvular process.  

Rheumatic valvular disease has declined in frequency in developed countries but remains an important condition globally. Rheumatic AS results from post- inflammatory fusion and adhesion of the valve commissures and rarely develops in the absence of rheumatic mitral involvement.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 540  

## B (Braunwald, Ch. 73: p. 1426)  

Appropriate timing for surgical intervention in chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) depends on the patient's symptoms and state of left ventricular (LV) contractile function. Patients with severe AR who have symptoms of heart failure (class II, III, IV) should be referred for surgical valve replacement, unless an absolute contraindication exists. Surgery is also advisable for asymptomatic patients with severe AR who have reduced LV ejection fraction less than \(55\%\) or a markedly increased end- systolic diameter greater than \(50 \mathrm{mm}\) . Conversely, patients with severe AR but normal LV systolic function and a nondilated LV have an excellent prognosis and typically can be observed clinically and by echocardiography to assess for changes in LV size and function.  

In patients who do undergo aortic valve surgery, the end- systolic diameter is valuable in predicting the postoperative outcome. An end- systolic diameter less than \(40 \mathrm{mm}\) predicts a low likelihood of postoperative instability or heart failure. However, an end- systolic diameter greater than \(50 \mathrm{mm}\) , or a preoperative ejection fraction less than

Non- AIDS conditions (including cardiovascular disease) account for the majority of deaths among patients with

In the modern ART era, most HIV- associated cardiovascular disease results from accelerated atherosclerosis, which occurs at an increased rate even in patients with well- controlled HIV compared with healthy individuals. Premature atherosclerosis is related to chronic vascular inflammation, increased vascular stiffness, and endothelial activation.  

HIV and ART can directly affect the myocardium as well. In the pre- ART era, HIV- associated dilated cardiomyopathy was commonly seen in patients with advanced HIV disease and was associated with a poor prognosis. With widespread use of ART, the incidence of HIV- associated dilated cardiomyopathy has decreased dramatically. However, subtle left ventricular (LV) abnormalities can develop in patients with well- controlled HIV on ART. For example, echocardiography can often detect mild LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac magnetic resonance may demonstrate subclinical myocardial edema and fibrosis. Putative mechanisms of myocardial damage include direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes, immune- mediated myocarditis, nutritional deficiencies, and direct toxicities of antiretroviral therapies.

Protease inhibitors, which are no longer first- line therapy in most modern ART regimens, carry an increased risk of myocardial infarction, likely related to worsened dyslipidemia and insulin resistance.

Turner syndrome, also termed gonadal dysgenesis, occurs in 1 of every 2500 females. Clinical features include primary amenorrhea, short stature, and immature genital and breast development. The condition arises from defects of the X chromosome, including the 45, XO karyotype in approximately \(50\%\) of cases. Cardiovascular abnormalities are common, occurring in \(20\%\) to \(50\%\) of patients. The most frequent manifestation is coarctation of the aorta, found in \(50\%\) to \(70\%\) of patients with Turner syndrome who have cardiovascular defects. Coarctation can occur alone or in combination with other aortic abnormalities, including bicuspid aortic valve and a dilated aortic root.  

Patients with Turner syndrome are also at increased risk for aortic dissection independent of other aortic abnormalities. Histopathologic studies have shown abnormalities of the elastic media similar to those in patients with diseases of collagen formation. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage is also found frequently in patients with this condition.

## B (Braunwald,Ch.100:p.1853)  

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X- linked recessive disorder that arises from mutations in the gene that encodes dystrophin. Most patients with DMD develop dilated cardiomyopathy, and specific mutations in the dystrophin gene predict ventricular dysfunction. Preclinical cardiac involvement is present in \(25\%\) of DMD patients by age 6 years. Up to \(90\%\) of patients with DMD who are 18 years of age or older will have developed echocardiographic evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy. There is a predilection for involvement of the inferobasal and lateral left ventricle, which likely accounts for the classic electrocardiographic abnormalities: tall R waves with increased R/S amplitude in \(\mathrm{V_1}\) and deep narrow Q waves in the left precordial leads (Fig. 4.45). There does not appear to be an association between the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy and electrocardiographic abnormalities.  

Persistent or labile sinus tachycardia is the most common arrhythmia in DMD. In advanced DMD cardiomyopathy, both atrial arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) and ventricular arrhythmias occur, similar to other cardiomyopathies.

The anthracycline antineoplastic agents (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and idarubicin) are widely recognized for their potential cardiac toxicity. Rarely, a single high dose of an anthracycline causes an acute cardiotoxic reaction manifested by atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and

conduction disturbances. The more common complication is chronic cardiomyopathy after long- term exposure. The major risk factor for this complication is the cumulative dose. Retrospective analyses have indicated that the incidence of heart failure is \(1.7\%\) at a cumulative dose of \(300\mathrm{mg / m^2}\) , \(4.7\%\) at \(400\mathrm{mg / m^2}\) , \(15.7\%\) at \(500\mathrm{mg / m^2}\) , and \(48\%\) at \(650\mathrm{mg / m^2}\) . Thus, oncologists typically limit the total dose to no more than \(400\mathrm{mg / m^2}\) , but cardiomyopathy can develop even below this total.  

Age at the time of exposure is another important risk factor: the very young and the very old are particularly susceptible. Additional risk factors for anthracycline cardiotoxicity include prior mediastinal radiation, the concurrent administration of other cardiotoxic agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide or trastuzumab), and a history of cardiac disease. For example, cardiomyopathy is more likely to arise when the baseline left ventricular ejection fraction is less than \(50\%\) .  

There are some dosing strategies than may mitigate the risk of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Continuous infusions of anthracyclines appear to have a lower risk of cardiotoxicity than conventional intravenous bolus dosing. Similarly, the liposomal formulation of doxorubicin may have a lower risk of cardiotoxicity than free doxorubicin.  

In randomized trials, the iron chelator dexrazoxane has demonstrated a protective effect against anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Because there has been concern that dexrazoxane may reduce anthracycline antineoplastic efficacy, its use is generally limited to patients who have received greater than \(300\mathrm{mg / m^2}\) of doxorubicin or its equivalent.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonists interfere with the vascular supply of tumors. The monoclonal antibody bevacizumab targets VEGF- A and, when combined with chemotherapy, improves survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic nonsquamous non- small cell lung cancer. Several adverse reactions may occur with this agent. Hypertension (not hypotension) is a common side effect and can be severe in \(8\%\) to \(20\%\) of patients. Bevacizumab is also associated with heart failure, and although the risk of precipitating left ventricular dysfunction is low, it is more likely to develop in patients who have also received anthracyclines or irradiation. There is an approximately two- fold increase in arterial (but not venous) thromboembolic events with bevacizumab.  

Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion is not a common side effect of bevacizumab therapy.

## B (Braunwald, Ch. 82: p. 1557; Fig. 82.14)  

Congenital heart lesions are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with Down syndrome. The most frequent abnormalities are endocardial cushion defects, including partial or complete atrioventricular septal defects. The typical presentation includes a history of poor weight gain and frequent respiratory infections in the first year of life. Cardiac auscultation findings depend on the degree of atrial and ventricular septal communications and whether there is atrioventricular valve involvement. In patients with the more common partial endocardial cushion defect, the examination findings are similar to those of an ostium primum atrial septal defect. There is a prominent midlystolic flow murmur (because of increased flow across the pulmonic valve) followed by wide, fixed splitting of \(S_{2}\) . A middiastolic murmur is also common, owing to increased flow through the tricuspid valve. When a cleft mitral valve is part of the partial endocardial cushion defect, a holostyotic murmur at the apex is present that frequently radiates toward the sternum, because the right atrium receives regurgitant flow in this condition. When interventricular communication exists as part of the defect, a holostyotic murmur is usually present at the mid- to lower left sternal border.  

A midlystolic click followed by a late systolic murmur at the apex describes the auscultatory findings of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs more frequently in patients with Down syndrome than in typical individuals, but it generally does not become evident until later in life.  

Choice A describes rheumatic mitral stenosis, choice D is the murmur of aortic regurgitation, and choice E represents aortic stenosis. These entities do not occur at an increased frequency in patients with Down syndrome.

Radiation therapy is used to treat several types of malignancies. Historically, the heart and vasculature were subjected to high doses of radiation in patients with lymphoma and in those with cancers of the breast, lung, or esophagus. As a consequence, cardiovascular complications are leading causes of mortality among long- term cancer survivors treated with older radiation techniques. Modern approaches since the 1980s have limited and focused radiation delivery to minimize heart exposure, which has led to a decline in cardiovascular complications.
