## ANSWER TO QUESTION 168  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 25: p. 445)  

This patient has multiple coronary risk factors, and his 10- year risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease is significantly elevated. The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol guidelines recommend a discussion of cardiovascular risk and initiation of moderate- intensity statin therapy for primary prevention of CV disease for individuals with an estimated 10- year risk of \(7.5\%\) or more.  

Because each doubling of statin dosage results in only another approximately \(6\%\) decline in low- density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, this patient would require a substantial increase in the dose of simvastatin to achieve further desired LDL reduction. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an advisory against augmenting simvastatin to \(80\mathrm{mg}\) daily because of an increased risk of muscle injury compared with patients taking lower doses. Furthermore, simvastatin is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P- 450 CYP3A4, which, if inhibited by other medications, leads to an augmented serum simvastatin level and the potential for increased toxicity, including myositis and rhabdomyolysis. Among commonly used CV medications, such impaired simvastatin metabolism can result from verapamil (which this patient takes), diltiazem, gemfibrozil, and amiodarone. The FDA advises that gemfibrozil not be prescribed concurrently with simvastatin, and that the dosage of simvastatin should not exceed \(10\mathrm{mg}\) daily for patients who also take verapamil, diltiazem, or amiodarone.  

As a reasonable next step, this patient could be switched to an alternate, higher- potency statin. For primary prevention for this patient at a \(7.5\%\) or more 10- year atherosclerotic risk, moderate- intensity regimens recommended by the 2018 ACC/AHA guidelines include atorvastatin 10 to \(20\mathrm{mg}\) daily or rosuvastatin 5 to \(10\mathrm{mg}\) daily. Optional high- intensity regimens include atorvastatin 40 to \(80\mathrm{mg}\) daily or rosuvastatin 20 to \(40\mathrm{mg}\) daily.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 169  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 26: p. 490)  

Lifestyle modifications benefit most individuals with hypertension. Obesity contributes to elevated blood pressure (BP), and even small degrees of weight loss can lower it, no matter what type of diet is employed.  

Modest sodium restriction can also improve hypertension. Reduction of dietary sodium intake to less than \(100\mathrm{mmol / day}\) (2.4 g of sodium or \(6\mathrm{g}\) sodium chloride) decreases systolic BP approximately 2 to \(8\mathrm{mm}\) Hg. Not all hypertensive individuals respond to lower salt intake, but some patients (African Americans and the elderly) may be particularly sensitive to sodium reduction. Adoption of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan—rich in fruits, vegetables, and low- fat dairy products and low in total and saturated fat—has been shown to reduce BP by \(11.4 / 5.5\mathrm{mm}\) Hg. Even greater reductions are manifest by combining the DASH diet with reduced sodium intake. Magnesium and calcium supplements have not been demonstrated to significantly reduce BP.  

Ethanol consumption of no more than \(1\mathrm{oz / day}\) (24 oz beer, 10 oz wine, 3 oz 80- proof liquor for a normal- size man and less for a woman) is associated with decreased cardiac mortality, but excessive alcohol intake exerts a pressor effect, so that alcohol abuse is a cause of reversible hypertension.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 170  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 26: pp. 488-489)  

Renovascular disease is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension and has two main etiologies. The most common cause (80%- 90% of cases) is atherosclerotic

<--- Page Split --->

disease affecting the proximal third of the main renal artery, typically seen in older men. The prevalence of atherosclerotic renovascular disease is higher with advanced age, diabetes, and evidence of atherosclerosis in other arterial beds.  

The second, and less common, form of renal artery stenosis is fibromuscular dysplasia, which primarily afflicts women aged 20 to 60 years. It involves mainly the distal two- thirds of the main renal artery, and, although all layers of the vessel may be affected, involvement of the media is most common. A renovascular etiology of hypertension should be suspected in patients who develop high blood pressure before age 30 years, or after age 50 years with the abrupt onset of severe and resistant hypertension and signs of atherosclerosis elsewhere, or in patients with recurrent sudden unexplained pulmonary edema. Bilateral renal artery stenosis should be suspected if renal insufficiency is present, especially if renal function worsens following initiation of angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy.  

The treatment of choice for renal fibromuscular dysplasia is balloon angioplasty of the affected segment. However, the cornerstone of therapy for patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease is pharmacologic control of blood pressure and other atherosclerotic risk factors such as dyslipidemia. Mechanical intervention should be reserved for patients with refractory hypertension or progressive renal insufficiency.2,3

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 171  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 26: p. 488)  

Essential hypertension accounts for approximately \(90\%\) of patients with elevated blood pressure. Renal parenchymal disease is the second most common cause, responsible for approximately \(5\%\) . Grouped together, coarctation of the aorta, Cushing disease, and pheochromocytoma contribute to less than \(1\%\) . Primary aldosteronism accounts for approximately \(1\%\) of hypertension in the general population, but a higher percentage \((\sim 11\%)\) in patients with resistant hypertension.2  

Pure "white coat" hypertension, in which blood pressures taken in the office are persistently elevated but out- of- office readings are not, is found in \(20\%\) to \(30\%\) of patients. Most patients with white coat hypertension are found to be free of target organ damage and have an excellent 10- year prognosis with respect to cardiovascular disease.  

When measuring the blood pressure, the correct cuff size should be used. The cuff bladder should encircle and cover two- thirds of the length of the arm. If the cuff bladder is too small, blood pressure readings may be spuriously high.3  

In elderly patients, the brachial arteries are often sclerotic and may not become occluded until the blood pressure cuff is inflated to a very high pressure. As a result, the recorded cuff pressure may be much higher than that measured intra- arterially, resulting in "pseudohypertenstion."

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 172  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 31: p. 567)  

The goal of glucose- lowering therapy for most type 2 diabetic patients is to achieve a hemoglobin A1c level of less than \(7.0\%\) , which reduces microvascular complications including diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. More recent attention has focused on the cardiovascular safety of these agents, including their effects on macrovascular events (i.e., myocardial infarction [MI], stroke). Notably, recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant cardiovascular outcomes benefits with specific glucagon- like peptide (GLP)- 1 receptor agonists and sodium- glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.1  

The LEADER trial randomized 9340 patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular disease to the GLP- 1 receptor agonist liraglutide or placebo, in addition to standard therapy.2 After a median follow- up of 3.8 years, the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke was significantly reduced in the liraglutide group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.97, \(P = .01\) for superiority). In the SUSTAIN- 6 trial, the GLP- 1 receptor antagonist semaglutide was randomized versus placebo in 3297 patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.3 After 104 weeks, the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke was significantly reduced in those receiving the GLP- 1 receptor antagonist (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.95, \(P = .02\) for superiority).  

In the EMPA- REG OUTCOME trial, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin was randomly assigned versus placebo to 7020 patients with type 2 diabetes and known cardiovascular disease.4 After a median of 3.1 years, there were fewer events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or stroke) in those randomized to empagliflozin (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.99, \(P = .04\) for superiority). In the CANVAS trials, patients randomized to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin also demonstrated a reduced composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke compared with placebo, but patients treated with this drug experienced a higher incidence of lower extremity amputations.5 More recent clinical trials have found that the risk of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease and amputation, while still a concern for which to be monitored, is lower than originally suggested. Other potential side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors include volume depletion and recurrent urinary tract infections.  

The thiazolidinedione pioglitazone was studied in a placebo- controlled randomized trial of 5238 patients with

<--- Page Split --->

type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the PRO- active trial. There was a lower incidence of a secondary endpoint (death, nonfatal MI, stroke) with pioglitazone. However, like other thiazolidinediones, it is associated with a higher incidence of heart failure in diabetics and should be avoided in this patient with a history of heart failure symptoms.  

An analysis of 19 trials of patients with type 2 diabetes concluded that the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor linagliptan does not increase the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke, but, unlike other agents described earlier, it is not associated with a reduction of these adverse cardiovascular events.  

The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on diabetes, prediabetes, and cardiovascular recommend initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP- 1 RA in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk to reduce mortality and major cardiovascular events. For the patient presented in this question, liraglutide is the preferred answer. His history of recurrent urinary tract infections makes the SGLT2 antagonist empagliflozin an inferior choice.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 173  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 26: p. 487)  

The use of oral contraceptives (OCs) is a cause of second- ary hypertension in young women. The risk of such individuals developing hypertension is increased by alcohol consumption, age over 35 years, and obesity and is likely related to the estrogen content of the agent. Because estrogen increases the hepatic production of angiotensinogen, a probable mechanism for hypertension induced by OCs is activation of the renin-angiotensin system, with subsequent sodium retention and volume expansion. Nonetheless, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not influence blood pressure to a greater degree in women with contraceptive- induced hypertension than in those with primary essential hypertension. Of note, blood pressure normalizes within 6 months of initiating OC therapy in approximately \(50\%\) of patients.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 174  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 26: p. 490)  

Per the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Hypertension Guidelines, this patient has stage 1 hypertension (Table 2.1) with a consistent systolic pressure \(130 \text{to} 139 \text{mm Hg}\) . The Guidelines recommend that his target blood pressure should be less than \(130 / 80 \text{mm Hg}\) . This endorsement is based in part on the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial, which randomized 9361 hypertensives with high cardiovascular risk to a systolic pressure target of either less than \(120 \text{mm Hg}\) or less than \(140 \text{mm Hg}\) . The trial was stopped early at 3.3 years when the lower blood pressure target group demonstrated superior outcomes, namely lower rates of acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death. Because blood pressure measurements taken in practice are generally higher than in the careful experimental setting of the SPRINT trial, the Hypertension Guidelines relaxed the target systolic pressure to less than \(130 \text{mm Hg}\) .  

All patients with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension (defined in Table 3.1) should follow lifestyle modifications that can improve blood pressure (e.g., a Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet, reduced sodium intake, weight loss if overweight, increased exercise, and moderation of ethanol intake [≤2 drinks/day for men, ≤1 drink/day for women]). Furthermore, the Guidelines recommend that antihypertensive drug therapy be initiated for patients with stage 2 hypertension, and for those with stage 1 hypertension who have a 10- year predicted cardiovascular risk greater than \(10\%\) using the ACC/AHA pooled cohort risk assessment equations (http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD- Risk- Estimator).  

Recommended initial drugs are those that have been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients, including angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide- type diuretics. Beta blockers are not recommended for initial therapy, as clinical trials have not shown a mortality benefit when used for hypertension (possibly in part because the key trials used inadequately dosed atenolol). In addition, for Black patients, thiazide- type diuretics and calcium channel blockers are more effective at lowering blood pressure than are beta blockers or drugs that interfere with the renin- angiotensin system.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 175  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 26: p. 490)  

All antihypertensive medications have potential side effects that may limit their use. Angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower blood pressure by blocking the formation of angiotensin II and by increasing the circulating concentration of the vasodilator bradykinin. The most common side effect is an annoying dry cough that occurs in \(5\%\) to \(20\%\) of patients taking ACE inhibitors, likely related to increased bradykinin. Its incidence is higher in African American and Asian patients compared with Caucasians. The cough may persist for more than 3 weeks after discontinuation of the medication. Substitution with an angiotensin receptor blocker results in a similar antihypertensive effect, without producing cough in the majority of affected patients.  

Calcium channel blockers vasodilate and lower blood pressure by interacting with plasma membrane L- type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and cardiac myocytes. A common side effect is ankle edema (which arises because of arterial \(>\) venous vasodilation). Less common adverse effects include headache, flushing, and gingival hyperplasia. Verapamil and diltiazem can also impair cardiac conduction and cause bradycardia.  

Hydralazine is a direct vasodilator with potential adverse effects that include tachycardia, flushing, and headaches. These side effects can be prevented, and the antihypertensive effect increased, by coadministration of a beta blocker.  

Minoxidil is a direct vasodilator that is occasionally used in patients with renal failure and severe hypertension. Its side effects include a reflex increase in cardiac output, fluid retention, and hirsutism. Approximately \(3\%\) of patients who take minoxidil develop a pericardial effusion, even in the absence of renal or cardiac dysfunction.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 26: pp. 491-492)  

Thiazide diuretics are frequently prescribed first- line agents for the treatment of hypertension, and they have a number of important side effects. The most common metabolic disturbance is hypokalemia; the hazard ratio for moderate or severe hypokalemia \((\leq 3.0 \mathrm{mmol / L})\) with any thiazide exposure is 2.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28 to 4.53) after adjustment for age, sex, renal function, and use of RAS inhibitors. The serum potassium level falls an average 0.7 mmol/L after institution of \(50 \mathrm{mg / day}\) of hydrochlorothiazide, and \(0.4 \mathrm{mmol / L}\) with \(25 \mathrm{mg / day}\) , but there is almost no decline with \(12.5 \mathrm{mg / day}\) . Hypomagnesemia with thiazides is usually mild but may prevent the restoration of an intracellular deficit of potassium.  

Hyperuricemia is present in one- third of untreated hypertensive persons, and it develops in another third during therapy with thiazide diuretics. This is likely a result of increased proximal tubular reabsorption of urate. There may also be a rise in serum calcium (usually \(< 0.5 \mathrm{mg / dL}\) ) on thiazide therapy, which is probably secondary to increased proximal tubular reabsorption. Hyponatremia may occur with thiazide therapy, especially in the elderly. Thiazides in higher dosages \((\geq 50 \mathrm{mg}\) daily) may increase total blood cholesterol, low- density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels in a dose- related fashion.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 177  

## D (Braunwald, Ch. 27: p. 515)  

The HMG- CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are competitive inhibitors of the rate- limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, primarily in the liver. By reducing the intracellular cholesterol concentration, the expression of cell- surface low- density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors is increased (resulting in enhanced removal of LDL particles from the circulation) and the hepatic production of very- low- density lipoprotein (VLDL), the precursor of LDL cholesterol, is reduced. As a result of these actions, total and LDL cholesterol levels fall, as do triglycerides, the major component of VLDL particles. Statins are very well tolerated. Reversible elevations of hepatic transaminases (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase) are almost always asymptomatic and rarely require stopping the drug. Myonecrosis, consisting of muscle aching or weakness in association with a serum creatine kinase level greater than 10 times normal, occurs in less than \(0.5\%\) of patients. This adverse effect mandates immediate discontinuation of the statin. The risk of myopathy is increased when there is concurrent therapy with other drugs that interfere with cytochrome P- 450 metabolism of many of the statins. Examples of such drugs include erythromycin, cyclosporine, and antifungal agents.

Many medications have the potential to alter a patient's lipid profile. Beta blockers, particularly non- beta1- selective agents, increase triglyceride levels and lower high- density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Thiazides tend to increase triglyceride levels.  

Hormonal replacement therapy with estrogen increases both HDL and triglyceride levels. Despite the augmented

<--- Page Split --->

HDL effect, the use of estrogen to improve the lipid profile is not recommended, because of an associated increase in cardiovascular events. Immunosuppressive drugs and corticosteroids can raise triglyceride levels.  

Protease inhibitors, for treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, may induce a dyslipidemic syndrome characterized by elevated triglyceride and total cholesterol levels with decreased HDL levels. Chronic use of protease inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction compared with antiretroviral regimens that do not include a protease inhibitor.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 179  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 27: p. 509)  

Most clinically encountered lipoprotein disorders arise from an interaction between diet, lack of exercise, excessive weight, and an individual's genetic composition. Genetic lipoprotein disorders may affect low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), and remnant lipoprotein molecules.  

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal co- dominant disorder that results from defects in the LDL receptor gene. More than 1000 different mutations of the LDL receptor gene have been described. Patients with FH have LDL levels greater than the \(95^{\text{th}}\) percentile for age and gender. Corneal arcus, tendinous xanthomas, and xanthelasmases are common. Men with heterozygous FH usually develop coronary artery disease (CAD) by the third or fourth decade. Affected women present 8 to 10 years later. Familial defective apolipoprotein B, which results from mutations in the APOB gene, is clinically indistinguishable from FH. It results in a reduced affinity of affected LDL particles for the LDL receptor.  

Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is one of the most common familial lipoprotein disorders. It is a polygenic condition with abnormalities that include elevations of LDL and/or triglycerides, a reduction in HDL, and elevated apo B levels. Patients with FCH have an increased risk of CAD, and there can be considerable clinical overlap between FCH and the insulin- resistance metabolic syndrome. Physical findings such as corneal arcus or xanthomas are rare.  

Familial hypertriglyceridemia (type IV hyperlipoproteinemia) is also a polygenic disorder and is characterized by elevated triglycerides with normal or low LDL levels and reduced HDL. Patients do not develop xanthomas or xanthelasmases, and the relationship with CAD is not as strong or consistent as with FCH.  

The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene (PCSK9) encodes a protease that binds to the LDL receptor and targets it for lysosomal degradation. Gain- of- function mutations in this gene decrease the availability of the LDL receptor, which causes higher plasma LDL cholesterol levels and an increased risk of ischemic heart disease. Loss- of- function mutations in this gene result in lower LDL- cholesterol and coronary event rates.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 180  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 27: pp. 518-519)  

Niacin (nicotinic acid) is a B vitamin with lipid- lowering effects when taken at pharmacologic doses. Its primary action is to reduce very- low- density lipoprotein secretion from the liver, which causes a subsequent reduction in intermediate- density lipoprotein and low- density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. In addition, niacin decreases the release of free fatty acids from adipocytes (which are used by the liver for triglyceride synthesis), thus reducing triglyceride levels. In therapeutic doses, niacin reduces LDL cholesterol by \(10\%\) to \(25\%\) and triglycerides by \(20\%\) to \(50\%\) and increases high- density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by \(15\%\) to \(35\%\) . The increase in HDL cholesterol is caused by decreased catabolism of HDL and apo AI. Niacin also reduces circulating levels of lipoprotein (a). Despite these effects on the lipid profile, its widespread use has been limited historically because of side effects, including flushing, hepatotoxicity, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, and gastritis.  

In the Coronary Drug Project, a trial of patients with prior myocardial infarction performed before the statin era, 15- year mortality was reduced in patients randomized to niacin therapy. However, in more recent trials of patients treated aggressively with statin therapy (AIM- HIGH, HPS2- THRIVE), the addition of niacin did not further lower cardiovascular risk compared with the statin alone.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 181  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 27: Table 27.2)  

The apoprotein components of lipoproteins serve several functions, including structural support, receptor recognition, and, in some cases, enzymatic activity. Apo AI is the major protein in high- density lipoprotein (HDL) and its concentration is inversely correlated with angiographic evidence of coronary disease. Circulating apo AI interacts with the ABCA1 transporter on peripheral cell membranes, initiating lipidation of HDL particles. Apo AI also activates the plasma enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase,

<--- Page Split --->

which esterifies free cholesterol, an important step in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway.  

The two forms of apoprotein B (apo B48 and apo B100) arise from a single gene that displays a unique editing mechanism that allows for synthesis of both proteins. Apo B100 is the primary apoprotein of low- density lipoprotein (LDL), allowing recognition of the particle by the LDL receptor on cell surfaces.  

Apoprotein E is found in very- low- density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles, as well as in chylomicrons, in intermediate- density lipoprotein (IDL) particles, and, to a small extent, in HDL. Most patients with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (also termed dysbetalipoproteinemia or broad beta disease) are homozygous for the apoprotein E2/2 genotype. This disorder is characterized by premature atherosclerosis and is notable for both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia owing to an increase in IDL and/ or VLDL particle populations.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 182  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 27: pp. 519-520)  

This patient's low- density lipoprotein cholesterol is within an acceptable range at less than \(70~\mathrm{mg / dL}\) , but the triglyceride level is elevated at \(250~\mathrm{mg / dL}\) . The REDUCE- IT trial was a large, randomized trial of 8179 patients with established cardiovascular disease, or diabetes plus additional risk factors, who manifested hypertriglyceridemia (135- 499 mg/dL) despite statin therapy. Patients were randomized to icosapent ethyl, an omega- 3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid derivative, \(2\mathrm{g}\) twice daily, or to placebo. Over the subsequent 4.9 years the patients randomized to icosapent ethyl experienced a \(25\%\) lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with the placebo group. Icosapent ethyl is distinct from over- the- counter fish oil preparations in that it contains a high concentration of purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester.  

This patient fits the profile of subjects in the REDUCE- IT trial and would be expected to benefit similarly from the addition of icosapent ethyl.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 183  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 27: p. 510)  

Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] consists of a low- density lipoprotein particle with its apo B100 component linked by a disulfide bridge to apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)]. Apo(a) is a complex molecule that has sequence homology with plasminogen. The latter structural feature has raised the possibility that Lp(a) may inhibit endogenous fibrinolysis by competing with plasminogen for binding at the endothelial surface.  

The primary determinant of Lp(a) levels is genetic; changes in diet and physical activity have no significant impact. In addition, Lp(a) levels vary widely across racial groups and are higher in African Americans compared with White Americans. In several studies, Lp(a) has been shown to be an independent risk factor for vascular risk. A metaanalysis of 36 prospective studies including more than 12,000 patients found that the adjusted risk ratio of cardiovascular events is 1.13 for each standard deviation increase in Lp(a). Niacin and PCSK9 inhibitors are among the few interventions that reduce Lp(a) levels; statins do not. However, no study to date has shown that targeted pharmacologic reduction of Lp(a) improves cardiovascular outcomes.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 184  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 27: p. 518)  

Fabric acid derivatives (e.g., gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) are used primarily to reduce elevated triglyceride levels. These agents interact with a nuclear transcription factor (PPAR- alpha) that regulates the transcription of the lipoprotein lipase, APOCII, and APOA1 genes. The resultant increase in lipoprotein lipase augments hydrolysis of triglycerides from very- low- density lipoproteins (VLDL) at peripheral tissues, which decreases VLDL and plasma triglyceride levels. However, this action may cause low- density lipoprotein (LDL) levels to rise. A meta- analysis of fibrate trials has shown a modest reduction in rates of myocardial infarction but no effect on mortality.  

Fish oils are rich in omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. They decrease plasma triglyceride levels by reducing VLDL synthesis and have antithrombotic effects. Other than the REDUCE- IT trial, using the highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid derivative icosapent ethyl (see Answer to Question 182), robust clinical studies to show efficacy of fish oils in reducing cardiovascular outcomes are lacking.  

Bile acid- binding resins prevent the reabsorption of bile acids from the small intestine, thereby reducing the return of cholesterol to the liver through the enterohepatic circulation, with subsequent upregulation of hepatic LDL receptors. The latter action enhances removal of LDL from the circulation. Resins are used occasionally as an adjunct to statins in patients with severe elevations of LDL cholesterol. Side effects include constipation, abdominal fullness, and hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, resins can interfere with the absorption of other medications, which therefore should be ingested at least 1 hour before or 3 hours after the resin.  

Ezetimibe selectively inhibits cholesterol uptake by intestinal epithelial cells and reduces LDL cholesterol when used alone or in combination with statins. The IMPROVE- IT trial compared the effect of ezetimibe plus simvastatin to simvastatin alone in 18,144 patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. Patients assigned to combined therapy achieved a median LDL cholesterol of 53.7 mg/dL compared with 69.5 mg/dL in those who

<--- Page Split --->

received simvastatin alone. The primary outcome (cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or need for coronary revascularization) was significantly lower in the ezetimibe plus simvastatin group \((32.7\%)\) vs. \(34.7\%\) , hazard ratio 0.94, \(P = .016\) .3

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 185  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 39: p. 721)  

This patient's clinical presentation, ECG abnormalities, and troponin elevation are consistent with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Acute therapy of NSTEMI is directed at clinical symptoms and stabilization of the culprit lesion. The two general treatment pathways of patients with NSTEMI are (1) an early invasive strategy (coronary angiography within 24-48 hours with revascularization as appropriate) and (2) a more conservative ischemia-guided strategy in which patients proceed to invasive evaluation only if they develop recurrent ischemic symptoms despite medical therapy, either spontaneously or on noninvasive stress testing. A third pathway involves emergent (<2 hour) coronary angiography and is reserved for NSTEMI patients with hemodynamic instability, shock, life-threatening arrhythmias, refractory chest discomfort, or other very high-risk features. Current guidelines recommend an early invasive strategy for initially stabilized patients who are at high risk for clinical events using risk stratification models such as the TIMI (Table 2.2) or

GRACE risk scores. The patient presented in this vignette has high TIMI and GRACE scores (calculated at 6 and 150, respectively), such that proceeding with an early invasive strategy is recommended.  

Regarding antiplatelet therapy, clinical guidelines do not recommend up-front loading of a \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) inhibitor in patients for whom an early invasive strategy is planned. Once coronary angiography has been performed and a revascularization strategy is in place, \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) choice should be considered. The potent \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) inhibitors ticagrelor and prasugrel are generally preferred over clopidogrel in patients at acceptable bleeding risk. Compared with clopidogrel, ticagrelor has a more rapid onset of action and a faster recovery of platelet function once the drug is stopped. In the PLATO trial, ticagrelor reduced the risk of vascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke compared with clopidogrel, without an increase in major bleeding. As a result, a class IIa recommendation of the 2016 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association dual antiplatelet therapy guidelines is that it is reasonable to prescribe ticagrelor in preference to clopidogrel for NSTEMI patients. A potential disadvantage of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel is a shorter half-life, necessitating twice daily dosage. Of note, ticagrelor's advantage over clopidogrel in the PLATO trial was found only in patients taking \(100\mathrm{mg}\) or less of aspirin daily, such that ticagrelor-treated patients should not take higher doses of aspirin.  

Prasugrel, like clopidogrel, is a thienopyridine and is an irreversible antagonist of the platelet \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) receptor. Prasugrel's onset of action is more rapid than that of clopidogrel, and in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial of acute coronary syndrome patients for whom percutaneous coronary intervention was planned, prasugrel reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by \(19\%\) , but at a cost of significantly increased bleeding. The bleeding risk was greatest in patients age 75 years or over and in those with reduced body weight (≤60 kg), such that those populations derived no net benefit from prasugrel, and patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) actually experienced net harm. The patient in this vignette has a history of TIA, and he should not receive prasugrel.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 186  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 45: p. 878)  

In the United States, stroke is the third leading cause of death; only heart disease and cancer are more common. Each year, more than 795,000 strokes occur, and of these, approximately 185,000 are recurrent events in patients with a history of stroke. Treatable risk factors for ischemic stroke include hypertension, diabetes, and cigarette smoking.

<--- Page Split --->

Blood pressure lowering is safe and beneficial in the period after an ischemic stroke, and the American Stroke Association recommends such therapy. For example, in the PROGRESS trial, \(^{2}\) 6105 stable patients with a recent stroke were randomized to placebo or antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretic. After 4 years, the relative risk of a new stroke declined by \(28\%\) in the patients randomized to the medical regimen compared with placebo.  

Although data relating hypercholesterolemia to stroke risk have been equivocal, statins have been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke in patients at increased risk of vascular disease. A meta- analysis of 90,000 patients in cholesterol- lowering trials showed that each \(10\%\) reduction in low- density lipoprotein (LDL) level reduced the risk of stroke by \(15.6\%\) . In the Heart Protection Study (see Answer to Question 424), treatment with simvastatin was associated with a highly significant reduction in stroke rates. In the SPARCL study, 4731 patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease (recent stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA]) and baseline LDL 100 to \(190~\mathrm{mg / dL}\) , but no known coronary disease, were randomized to atorvastatin \(80~\mathrm{mg}\) daily or placebo. After a mean follow- up of 4.9 years, there was a \(16\%\) reduction in subsequent stroke rates. \(^{3}\)  

After a stroke or TIA, aspirin reduces the risk of stroke recurrence by \(12\%\) to \(17\%\) . In patients with a history of stroke, MI, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease, clopidogrel monotherapy reduces the risk of future MI, stroke, or vascular death by \(8.7\%\) compared with aspirin alone. For patients with mild stroke or high- risk TIA, trials support the short- term combination of dual antiplatelet thepav (e.g., aspirin plus clopidogrel) over single antiplatelet therapy for prevention of recurrent stroke. \(^{4}\) However, over the long term, dual antiplatelet therapy results in no benefit over aspirin alone and an increased risk of bleeding. For example, in the MATCH trial, the combination of aspirin plus clopidogrel was compared with aspirin alone in 7599 patients who had sustained an ischemic stroke or TIA. \(^{5}\) After 18 months, there was a nonsignificant reduction in the primary outcome (a composite of ischemic stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, or vascular death) without a difference in all- cause mortality; life- threatening bleeding was higher in the combination group. Thus, a currently recommended option for patients with minor stroke or high- risk transient ischemic attack is dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 to 90 days, commenced shortly after symptom onset, followed by single antiplatelet therapy over the long term. \(^{1}\)  

In the PRoFESS study, aspirin plus dipyridamole was comparable with clopidogrel monotherapy for secondary stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic stroke; however, there were more major hemorrhages in the aspirin plus dipyridamole group. \(^{6}\)  

In three large trials of aspirin versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), VKAs did not reduce ischemic events but they increased the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. \(^{2}\)

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 187  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 25: pp. 459-461)  

Alcohol's interaction with the cardiovascular system is complex. Heavy alcohol intake is associated with increased cardiovascular and total mortality rates. In distinction, several primary and secondary prevention studies have found that the relation between alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease is J- shaped, in that moderate (1- 2 drinks) daily intake of alcohol is associated with lower risk compared with individuals who do not drink any alcoholic beverages, although this association remains controversial. \(^{1}\) Alcohol's beneficial effects may be a result of its ability to raise high- density lipoprotein levels, improve fibrinolysis, and reduce platelet aggregation. Alcohol intake is not associated with decreased low- density lipoprotein levels.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 188  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 25: pp. 446-447)  

Cigarette smoking is one of the strongest risk factors for coronary artery disease but is also one of the hardest to modify. \(^{1}\) Among its deleterious effects, smoking increases platelet aggregation, serum fibrinogen, and oxidation of low- density lipoprotein cholesterol. Patients who continue to smoke after a myocardial infarction have twice the mortality rate of those who stop.  

Observational studies show that smoking cessation reduces the risk of a coronary event by \(50\%\) within 2 years, compared with patients who continue to smoke. The cardiovascular risk approaches a person who never smoked after 3 to 5 years of smoking cessation.  

Addiction to nicotine can be intense. Patients who successfully quit smoking usually do so after five or more unsuccessful attempts. Physician counseling alone carries a poor success rate, with only \(6\%\) of patients achieving 1 year of abstinence. Greater success is achieved when pharmacologic aids are included in the treatment program, along with counseling. Agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for smoking cessation include (1) nicotine replacement therapy (available as patches, gums, lozenges, nasal spray, and an inhaler), (2) the psychoactive drug bupropion, and (3) varenicline, a partial nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 189  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 33: p. 589)  

Comprehensive rehabilitation for patients with coronary disease includes physical exercise training, which benefits the cardiovascular system and skeletal muscle in ways that improve work performance. Different formats for outpatient physical activity include supervised and unsupervised programs. In supervised programs, the aerobic training goal is typically exercising to \(70\%\) to \(80\%\) of the maximum predicted heart rate; some patients may require lower intensities. In unsupervised home programs, patients are encouraged to exercise to the onset of mild dyspnea, which eliminates the need for monitoring the pulse rate.  

Several meta- analyses have studied the relation between exercise- based cardiac rehabilitation and clinical outcomes and have come to similar conclusions: mortality rates are lower among exercise program participants compared with patients who did not participate. Most of the studies included in these meta- analyses were performed before the current era of aggressive revascularization and may overestimate the expected mortality results in current practice.  

During exercise, an increase in heart rate accounts for a greater percentage of the augmented cardiac output than does the rise in stroke volume. In addition, at rest, the heart extracts about \(75\%\) of oxygen in the coronary flow. Because of the limited reserve, any increase in myocardial oxygen demand must be met by augmentation of coronary blood flow. With physical training, half the improvement in exercise performance is due to increased cardiac output and half to peripheral adaptations that actually improve oxygen extraction.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 190  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 25: p. 455)  

Homocysteine is an amino acid derived from the demethylation of dietary methionine. Inherited disorders of methionine metabolism cause extremely high levels of homocysteine, as well as homocystinuria. The most common cause of severe hyperhomocystinemia is cystathionine beta- synthase deficiency. Patients with this genetic defect present with atherothrombosis as early as the first decade of life. In contrast, mild to moderate elevations in homocysteine \((>15\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L})\) are common in the general population. Such elevations are often due to insufficient dietary intake of folate, use of folate antagonists such as methotrexate, polymorphisms in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene, hypothyroidism, or renal insufficiency.  

A large number of epidemiologic studies have shown a link between mildly elevated homocysteine levels and atherosclerosis.1 Folic acid supplementation can decrease homocysteine levels by approximately \(25\%\) . Additional vitamin \(\mathrm{B}_{12}\) supplementation typically reduces levels by another \(7\%\) . Nevertheless, clinical studies that have included over 37,000 subjects have shown that reduction in plasma homocysteine concentration with B- vitamin supplements does not reduce the risk of atherothrombotic events.2

## D (Braunwald, Ch. 25: p. 448)  

Metabolic syndrome is a common constellation of risk factors that greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance, the underlying abnormality in metabolic syndrome, may in part explain the association between hyperglycemia and atherosclerosis. Because it precedes overt diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance may also explain why many patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes already have extensive vascular disease. The severity of insulin resistance correlates with the rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas decreasing insulin resistance pharmacologically may reduce vascular events.1  

Early study of metabolic syndrome was hampered by the absence of a universal definition of this process. In 2009, a joint definition of metabolic syndrome was published by the International Diabetes Federation, the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and the American Heart Association. According to this definition, metabolic syndrome exists when three or more of the following are present: fasting serum glucose of \(110~\mathrm{mg / dL}\) or more, abdominal obesity (waist circumference above a region/ ethnicity- specific threshold, generally \(>85\) to \(102~\mathrm{cm}\) in men or \(>80\) to \(90~\mathrm{cm}\) in women), serum triglycerides of \(150~\mathrm{mg /}\) dL or more, low serum high- density lipoprotein cholesterol \((< 40~\mathrm{mg / dL}\) in men or \(< 50~\mathrm{mg / dL}\) in women), and hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] \(\geq 130\) and/or diastolic BP \(\geq 85~\mathrm{mm~Hg}\) ).2

Many nonpharmacologic approaches have been proposed for treatment of hypertension.

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, which

emphasizes consumption of fruit, vegetables, and low- fat dairy products, with low intake of saturated fat, reduced systolic blood pressure by approximately \(10\mathrm{mm}\) Hg and diastolic blood pressure by \(5\mathrm{mm}\) Hg among hypertensives.1 Garlic contains a compound (allicin) that inhibits angiotensin II, thus inducing vasodilation and blood pressure reduction. A meta- analysis of garlic ingestion in hypertensives showed a blood pressure reduction of \(9.1\mathrm{mm}\) Hg systolic and \(3.8\mathrm{mm}\) Hg diastolic at a daily dose of approximately \(600\) to \(900\mathrm{mg}\) .2 There was a high degree of heterogeneity and overall low quality of evidence in this meta- analysis.  

Slow breathing has been shown to increase parasympathetic activity and reduce sympathetic activation. Use of a device- guided biofeedback program of slow breathing has been shown to be associated with a significant blood pressure reduction in a meta- analysis of eight studies, though there was significant variation in the study results.3 Although a small number of studies have suggested a possible acute, nonsustained improvement in blood pressure with acupuncture, the overall data quality is poor, and two meta- analyses concluded that the current evidence is inconclusive.4

Several clinical trials have examined the effects of diet on reducing cardiovascular events. The Lyon Diet Heart study randomized patients with coronary artery disease to either a Mediterranean- style diet (rich in fruits, legumes, vegetables, and fiber and reduced in meat, butter, and cream), supplemented with alpha- linolenic acid- enriched margarine, or a control diet. Despite a similar percentage of total fat in each diet and similar lipid profiles, there was a significant reduction in all- cause mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in the Mediterranean- style diet group compared with the control group. In the primary prevention PREDIMED study, individuals without known cardiovascular disease, but who were at increased risk, were randomized to a Mediterranean- style diet (supplemented with extra- virgin olive oil or mixed nuts) or a control diet with advice to reduce dietary fat intake. After a median follow- up of 4.8 years, there were fewer cardiac events in the patients randomized to the Mediterranean diets.2  

A pooled estimate of two randomized controlled trials of either regular fatty fish consumption (200- 400 g/week) or fish oil supplementation ( \(\sim 900\) EPA and DHA per day) in coronary artery disease patients showed a reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.89).3  

A diet of reduced- carbohydrate, high- protein, and high- fat content was shown to result in greater weight loss at 12 months, increased high- density lipoprotein, and reduced triglycerides compared with a low- calorie, high- carbohydrate, low- fat diet, but has not been shown in controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular events.4

Aspirin has proven efficacy in acute treatment and secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI).1 Clinical trials support the administration of \(325~\mathrm{mg}\) in the acute setting and \(81~\mathrm{mg / day}\) in chronic usage.2 Studies prior to the acute reperfusion era showed that beta blocker therapy initiated during the convalescent phase of ST- segment elevation MI (STEMI) reduced long- term mortality by \(23\%\) . Observational studies in patients who have undergone primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI also generally support the use of beta blocker therapy for secondary prevention.3 In the absence of contraindications, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend oral beta blocker therapy for at least 2 to 3 years post- MI.4  

Angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is another important therapy during and after hospitalization for MI. In large clinical trials, more than 120,000 patients have been randomized to an ACE inhibitor or placebo in the setting of acute MI (regardless of left ventricular [LV] function), and the results are consistent: ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality during and after the acute event. The greatest benefit accrues during the first week post- MI, especially in the highest- risk patients. Putative beneficial effects include vasodilatation, increased production of nitric oxide, decreased aldosterone secretion, lowered sympathetic tone, and reduced adverse LV remodeling. In addition, in patients with documented LV dysfunction after MI, ACE inhibitor use has been associated with a \(20\%\) to \(30\%\) relative risk reduction in mortality over approximately 3 years of follow- up.4  

Many studies support the benefit of statin therapy for secondary prevention after MI.5 The 4S and CARE trials examined the effects of statins after MI among patients with elevated and average cholesterol levels, respectively. Each demonstrated a marked reduction in cardiovascular death and MI in patients randomized to the cholesterol- lowering regimen. The PROVE IT- TIMI 22 trial of patients with an acute coronary syndrome showed superior long- term outcomes with a high- intensity statin (atorvastatin \(80~\mathrm{mg}\) daily) compared with less intense therapy (pravastatin \(40~\mathrm{mg}\) daily), such that higher- dose regimens are the standard of care.6,7

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 195  

## A (Braunwald, Ch. 27: pp. 509-510)  

Inherited mutations in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) occur in the gene that codes for the low- density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. Heterozygotes inherit one mutant gene and one normal gene and therefore produce only half the normal number of receptors. Heterozygote FH affects approximately 1 in 500 persons, with an even higher frequency in populations with a founder effect. Homozygotes inherit two mutant alleles and so have virtually no LDL receptors. Physicians rarely see homozygotes, whose frequency in the population is 1 in 1 million.  

FH heterozygotes commonly present with tendon xanthomas, which are nodules that may involve the Achilles tendon and various extensor tendons of the forearm and leg. They consist of deposits of cholesterol derived from LDL particles. Cutaneous planar xanthomas occur only in homozygotes and usually manifest within the first 6 years of life. These xanthomas are yellow to bright orange and occur over areas of trauma. Both the heterozygous and homozygous forms of FH are associated with an increased incidence of coronary artery disease, the homozygous form far more severely than the heterozygous form. The presence of FH may be verified by assaying the density of functional LDL receptors on circulating lymphocytes or by genetic testing, although this is rarely clinically necessary.

## B (Braunwald, Ch. 27: pp. 511-512)  

Familial hypertriglyceridemia is a relatively common disorder in which the concentration of very- low- density lipoprotein is elevated in the plasma. The prevalence is between 1 in 100 and 1 in 50. Affected patients do not usually exhibit  

hypertriglyceridemia until puberty or early adulthood, at which time plasma triglyceride levels are moderately elevated, in the range of 200 to \(500~\mathrm{mg / dL}\) . Both low- density lipoprotein and high- density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are usually reduced. These individuals exhibit only a slightly increased incidence of atherosclerosis, and it is unclear whether this is caused by the hypertriglyceridemia, by accompanying decreases in HDL cholesterol, or by associated illnesses. Patients with hypertriglyceridemia can experience severe exacerbations, with plasma triglyceride levels as high as \(1000~\mathrm{mg / dL}\) , when exposed to a variety of precipitating factors (e.g., excessive alcohol ingestion, poorly controlled diabetes, use of birth control pills containing estrogen, or hypothyroidism), or even after a meal. Such high triglyceride levels may lead to pancreatitis and eruptive xanthomas.  

The disorder appears to be genetically heterogeneous, in that patients from different families may have different mutations. No consistent abnormalities of lipoprotein structure or receptor function have been described. Lipoprotein electrophoresis shows an increase in the prebeta fraction (type IV lipoprotein pattern). Affected individuals can often be treated by controlling the exacerbating conditions, such as obesity, and restricting the intake of fats and alcohol.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 197  

## B (Braunwald, Ch. 41: p. 793)  

Stent thrombosis is an uncommon, but potentially devastating complication of coronary stenting. Stent thrombosis that occurs immediately after stent implantation is referred to as acute thrombosis, an occurrence within the first month is termed subacute thrombosis, and late thrombosis denotes cases that occur thereafter. Stent thrombosis is effectively prevented by the combination of aspirin and an inhibitor of the platelet \(\mathrm{P2Y}_{12}\) receptor (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor). In the case of bare metal stents (BMSs), the risk of thrombosis is greatest within the first month after implantation. Newer- generation drug- eluting stents (DESs) manifest lower rates of stent thrombosis than BMS and first- generation DESs and are recommended for any percutaneous coronary intervention, regardless of anticipated dual antiplatelet therapy interruption. Clinical decision tools are under study to clarify which patients would be expected to benefit from long- term \(\mathrm{P2Y}_{12}\) inhibitor therapy versus shorter duration for those at high bleeding risk.  

The strongest predictor for stent thrombosis is premature cessation of antiplatelet therapies. Other factors that increase this risk include stent placement in small vessels, long stents, overlapping stents, multiple lesions, ostial or bifurcation lesions, prior brachytherapy, a suboptimal stent result (e.g., underexpansion or residual dissection), low ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 21: pp. 364-366; Ch 101: pp. 1875-1876)  

The patient described in this question has likely experienced renal atheromebolism, triggered by the catheterization procedure. Atheromeboli can be produced by mechanical manipulation of the aorta via catheters or surgery, and the kidneys are common targets for such embolism. This complication can result in acute renal failure with a stepwise decline in function. Some patients may progress to end- stage renal disease, whereas others recover full kidney function. The emboli may lodge in terminal arteries of the kidney, causing localized glomerular ischemia, or may compromise the large arteries and result in the loss of entire renal function.1,2  

The urinalysis is often unremarkable, with only mild proteinuria and a bland sediment. Rarely, lipid droplets in the urine can be observed. Peripheral eosinophilia and low serum complement levels may be present. Livedo reticularis, the purple discoloration described in this patient and shown in the figure, occurs in \(50\%\) of patients and is due to areas of impaired perfusion, most often in the lower extremities. Other cutaneous manifestations of atheromebolic disease include purple toes, purpura, and gangrene. Often, the diagnosis of renal embolization can be made on clinical grounds alone. If there is cutaneous involvement, biopsy of the skin and muscle may be helpful. Renal biopsy may provide useful information but carries a significant complication rate. The management of atheromeboli centers on supportive care, which may include hemodialysis. Large emboli may be amenable to surgical or catheter removal.  

Contrast nephropathy after angiographic procedures can also result in renal insufficiency. Findings that point to atheromeboli rather than a contrast effect as the cause of renal dysfunction include: (1) evidence of peripheral emboli to other sites (e.g., the cutaneous manifestations described in the previous paragraph), (2) the presence of eosinophilia and reduced complement levels, and (3) prolonged renal dysfunction (e.g., \(>1\) week).

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 199  

## C (Braunwald, Ch. 27: pp. 506-507)  

Low- density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major cholesterol- carrying component of the plasma. It is formed mainly from metabolism of hepatic- derived very- low- density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the circulation: VLDL undergoes hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase to form intermediate- density lipoprotein, which is then further delipidated by hepatic lipase to form LDL. The major lipid components of LDL are esterified cholesterol and triglyceride. Apo B100 is the predominant protein present in LDL and comprises approximately \(25\%\) of LDL mass. Cells internalize LDL after it binds to cell surface LDL receptors.   

Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused predominantly by mutations in one of three genes (the LDL receptor gene, the apolipoprotein B gene, and the PCSK9 gene) resulting in plasma LDL cholesterol levels greater than \(190\mathrm{mg / dL}\) and often premature coronary artery disease. Approximately \(7\%\) of American adults have a plasma LDL levels of \(190\mathrm{mg / dL}\) or higher, but fewer than \(2\%\) of such individuals actually have a familial hypercholesterolemia mutation.1

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 200  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 25: pp. 455-457)  

C- reactive protein (CRP), a circulating member of the pentraxin family, plays an important role in innate immunity. It is formed primarily in the liver but is also elaborated from coronary arteries, especially atherosclerotic intima. Levels of CRP are elevated in inflammatory states, and multiple epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that CRP measured by high- sensitivity assays (hsCRP) is strongly associated with myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and sudden death.1 hsCRP levels can be classified as low \((< 1\mathrm{mg / L})\) , intermediate \((1 - 3\mathrm{mg / L})\) , or high \((>3\mathrm{mg / L})\) . In patients with acute coronary events, high hsCRP levels are associated with worse outcomes, including increased mortality.2  

An elevated level of hsCRP also predicts the onset of type 2 diabetes, perhaps because it correlates with insulin sensitivity, endothelial dysfunction, and hypofibrinolysis. Many medications lower hsCRP levels, in particular statins, fibrates, and niacin. Statin therapy reduces hsCRP levels largely unrelated to the low- density lipoprotein (LDL)- lowering effect.3 Furthermore, statin therapy has been shown to benefit patients with relatively normal LDL, if the hsCRP is elevated. In the JUPITER trial, rosuvastatin resulted in a \(44\%\) reduction in vascular events in apparently healthy individuals with baseline LDL less than \(130\mathrm{mg / dL}\) and hsCRP greater than \(2\mathrm{mg / L}\) .4,5  

Aspirin does not directly lower hsCRP levels but appears to have the greatest cardiovascular benefit in patients with elevated baseline hsCRP.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 26: pp. 488-489)  

As reviewed in the Answer to Question 170, there are two major forms of renovascular disease: atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerotic patients are older and have higher systolic blood pressure, greater target organ damage, and evidence of atherosclerotic disease elsewhere. Patients with fibromuscular hyperplasia are younger, are more often female, have no family history of hypertension, and have less evidence of target organ damage. Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia are less likely to progress to complete renal artery occlusion or develop ischemic nephropathy compared with patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 202  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 26: p. 492)  

Hypertension frequently accompanies diabetes and greatly augments the risk of cardiovascular events in this population. Control of hypertension reduces future cardiovascular events in diabetics even more than in nondiabetics, and all diabetics with a persistent blood pressure (BP) greater than \(130 / 80 \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}\) should be on antihypertensive therapy. Many BP- lowering agents, including diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta blockers, have been shown to improve blood pressure control in diabetics, and there has been much controversy about whether one group is superior to others in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Early small studies suggested that ACE inhibitors were superior to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in this regard. However, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Sys- Eur), and HOT trials found that the degree of blood pressure control is more important than the agents used to achieve it; the antihypertensives captopril, atenolol, and the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers felodipine and nitrendipine all led to beneficial reductions in cardiovascular events.  

Drugs that interfere with the renin- angiotensin system do appear to have a special place in the treatment of diabetic patients, especially with renal disease. In patients with type 1 diabetes, ACE inhibitors slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy and end- stage renal disease, and several studies have demonstrated that ARBs provide similar benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, in the Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation study, the ACE inhibitor ramipril reduced cardiac events, stroke risk, and death in diabetic patients. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint study randomized 1195 diabetic patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy to the ARB losartan or atenolol therapy. Although blood pressure control was similar in both groups, those who received the ARB had reduced all- cause mortality.   

In the ACCORD trial, very aggressive reduction of BP, targeting systolic BP less than \(120 \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}\) was compared with "standard" therapy at the time (target systolic BP \(< 140 \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}\) ) in 4733 type 2 diabetics without advanced renal dysfunction. The more aggressive blood pressure lowering failed to reduce the composite primary outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes over a mean follow- up of 4.7 years. While intensive therapy led to a reduction of the prespecified secondary outcome endpoint of stroke, it also caused significantly more serious adverse effects, including hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, syncope, and renal failure.  

Based on results from major trials, the 2017 American hypertension practice guideline recommends a treatment BP goal of less than \(130 / 80 \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}\) in diabetics.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 203  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 38: p. 671)  

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction has several important differences and advantages when compared with pharmacologic fibrinolysis. The safety and success rate in establishing reperfusion \((>90\%)\) is superior to that of fibrinolytic agents, and there is less likelihood of developing complications such as reocclusion, reinfarction, and stroke with primary PCI. Multiple studies have demonstrated that primary PCI, when performed at experienced centers, results in a significant reduction in the rates of death \((7\%\) vs. \(9\%\) ), reinfarction \((3\%\) vs. \(9\%\) ), stroke \((1\%\) vs. \(2\%\) ), and hemorrhagic stroke \((0.05\%\) vs. \(1\%\) ) compared with fibrinolysis. In addition, primary angioplasty has been associated with shorter hospital stays and lower follow- up costs. Patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock are at the highest risk of death and cardiovascular complications. The SHOCK trial randomized 302 patients with cardiogenic shock to early revascularization or medical management. Early revascularization with primary PCI or urgent bypass surgery was associated with improved

survival at 6 months (49.7% vs. 36.9%, \(P = .027\) ) and 1 year (46.7 vs. 33.6%, \(P = .025\) ).

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 204  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 38: p. 671)  

Part \(A\) of the image is a right anterior oblique caudal view of the left coronary artery showing total proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD), the presumed culprit lesion. Within the mid-left circumflex (LCx) there is an \(80\%\) stenosis. Part \(B\) is a left anterior oblique view of the right coronary artery (RCA) showing a \(60\%\) stenosis of the midvessel and \(90\%\) stenosis of the distal vessel.  

Approximately half of patients who undergo coronary angiography for ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have multivessel disease. Previously, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of a non- infarct- related artery at the time of primary PCI for STEMI in hemodynamically stable patients was a class III (considered harmful) recommendation of American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. This caution was based on the combination of observational data and safety concerns, including increased contrast exposure and longer procedure times, as well as concern for a possibly increased risk of stent thrombosis during the heightened inflammatory state of the acute STEMI.  

Subsequent to the 2013 ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines, four small randomized controlled trials of multivessel PCI at the time of primary PCI, or as a planned, staged procedure led to reconsideration of this recommendation. These trials were PRAMI, CvLPRIT, DANAMI- 3- PRIMULTI, and PRAGUE- 13. In three of these trials, a strategy of multivessel PCI (at the time of primary PCI or a later planned, staged procedure) was shown to be safe and to benefit composite cardiovascular outcomes (PRAMI: hazard ratio [HR] 0.35, \(95\%\) confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.58, \(P < .001\) ; CvLPRIT: HR 0.49, \(95\%\) CI, 0.24 to 0.84, \(P = .009\) ; DANAMI- 3- PRIMULTI: HR 0.56, \(95\%\) CI, 0.38 to 0.83, \(P = .004\) ). However, in the PRAGUE- 13 trial, randomization to revascularization of all noninfarct stenoses of \(70\%\) or more diameter did not result in improved cardiovascular outcomes (death, nonfatal myocardial infarct, stroke) compared with culprit- only PCI.  

As a result of these newer trials, the 2016 focused update STEMI guidelines upgraded the recommendation of multivessel PCI at the time of primary culprit vessel PCI, or as a subsequent staged procedure, in hemodynamically stable patients, to class IIb ("may be reasonable").  

Subsequent to this evolution in guidelines, the COMPLETE trial was published in 2019. This study randomized patients with STEMI and at least one nonculprit severe stenosis to culprit- only PCI or staged complete revascularization within 45 days. Patients randomized to complete revascularization had lower rates of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarct at 3 years.  

The patient in this question presents with an acute anterior STEMI with proximal occlusion of the LAD, the culprit vessel, as well as high- grade lesions within the LCx and RCA. The LAD should be reperfused expeditiously. Consideration may be given to PCI of the LCx and/or RCA at the time of the LAD PCI, or as a staged procedure in this hemodynamically stable patient.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 205  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 38: p. 703)  

Studies have revealed that atrial infarction occurs in \(7\%\) to \(17\%\) of autopsy- proven cases of myocardial infarction. Atrial infarction is often seen in conjunction with left ventricular infarction and more commonly involves the right atrium than the left. This difference may reflect the presence of well- oxygenated blood in the left atrium, which could help nourish an ischemic atrial wall. Atrial infarction is frequently accompanied by supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, sinus arrhythmia, and wandering atrial pacemaker. In addition, atrial infarction may be complicated by rupture of the atrial wall.

Free wall rupture is one of the most lethal complications of acute myocardial infarction (MI) because it usually leads to hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. Rupture typically arises after a large MI in the left anterior descending

<--- Page Split --->

artery territory at the junction of infarcted and normal muscle. Whereas older series have quoted an incidence of free wall rupture of approximately \(5\%\) , occurring within 3 to 6 days after MI, more recent observations implicate an incidence of \(1\%\) to \(2\%\) , occurring primarily within the first 48 hours. Patients with free wall rupture tend to have had greater delays to hospitalization and are more likely to have been physically active after the onset of MI. Additional risk factors include advanced age, female gender, a history of hypertension, and the absence of previous infarction. It is thought that patients with prior MI are "protected" against rupture, because previous scars may reduce the magnitude of the shear forces between the fresh infarct and the healthy myocardium. The rate of free wall rupture is lower after primary percutaneous coronary intervention than after fibrinolytic therapy.  

The frequency of free wall rupture has decreased over time, and survival has improved but remains poor.

Patients with right ventricular infarction (RVI) may have a hemodynamic profile that resembles that of patients with pericardial disease. For example, elevations in right atrial (RA) and right ventricle (RV) filling pressures, as well as a rapid RA \(y\) descent and an early diastolic dip- and- plateau ("square root sign") may occur. In addition, the Kussmaul sign may be present in patients with RVI and is highly predictive for RV involvement in the setting of inferior wall infarction. Patients who present with inferior wall infarction who are suspected of having RV involvement should have an ECG obtained with precordial leads placed on the right side of the chest: most patients with RVI demonstrate ST- segment elevation of \(1\mathrm{mm}\) or more in lead \(\mathrm{V}_4\mathrm{R}\) (not standard lead \(\mathrm{V}_4\) ). Echocardiography can confirm the presence of RV dilatation and depression of systolic function and is able to distinguish RVI from other hemodynamically similar conditions, including pericardial tamponade and constrictive pericarditis.  

From a hemodynamic standpoint, treatment is typically aimed at increasing RA and RV filling pressures through administration of intravenous fluids to maintain normal left- sided preload. A marked hypotensive response to nitroglycerin may be a clinical clue to the presence of RVI, reflecting the impact of RV filling pressure in this condition. Similarly, the contribution of atrial contraction to RV filling is important in patients with RVI. Thus, patients who require pacemaker therapy benefit from atrioventricular sequential pacing, which has been shown to improve hemodynamic parameters in this condition.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 208  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 38: pp. 697-698)  

The progressive development of mitral regurgitation (MR) in this 60- year- old patient after an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) is most consistent with infarction of the posterior papillary muscle. Because papillary muscles are perfused via terminal portions of the coronary vascular bed, they are particularly vulnerable to ischemia. The posterior papillary muscle, supplied usually by only the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery, is more susceptible to ischemia and infarction than the anterolateral papillary muscle, which has a dual blood supply from the diagonal branches of the left anterior descending artery and the marginal branches from the left circumflex artery. Although necrosis of a papillary muscle is a potential complication of MI, particularly of inferior infarction, frank rupture is far less common. Total papillary muscle rupture is usually fatal because of the extremely severe and rapid- onset MR that it produces. MR may also develop later after MI, in which case it usually results from left ventricular dilatation. In that case, dyskinesis of the left ventricle results in an abnormal spatial relationship between the papillary muscles and the chordae tendineae, hence promoting MR.  

Rupture of chordae tendineae is also an important cause of MR, but such an event bears no special relation to MI. Common causes of chordal rupture include congenitally abnormal chordae, infective endocarditis, trauma, rheumatic fever, and myxomatous degeneration. Posterior chordae rupture spontaneously more frequently than do anterior chordae.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 209  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 38: p. 704)  

Post- myocardial infarction (MI) pericarditis has become uncommon in the era of acute coronary reperfusion therapies, likely because pharmacologic and mechanical interventions limit infarct size. In a modern series, the incidence of early post- MI pericarditis in 743 patients with acute ST- segment elevation myocardial infarctions treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention was \(4.2\%\) , with an increasing prevalence in patients with longer delays to hospital presentation. Post- MI pericarditis can develop as early as the first day after the infarction. The diagnosis is often based on the presence of pleuritic, positional chest pain that may radiate to the trapezius ridge and/or a pericardial friction rub; typical ECG changes of pericarditis are less common. Post- MI pericardial effusions are found most often in patients with larger infarcts, when congestive heart failure is present, and in the setting of an anterior MI; progression to tamponade is rare. Early post- MI pericarditis is best treated with high- dose aspirin (e.g., \(650\mathrm{mg}\) four to six times daily); other nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids should be avoided, as they may interfere with healing of the infarct. Anticoagulation should be avoided if possible

in the setting of post- MI pericarditis to avoid the uncommon complication of hemorrhagic tamponade.  

Dressler syndrome is a form of pericarditis that may occur 1 to 8 weeks after infarction. Patients present with malaise, fever, pericardial pain, leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, and pericardial effusion. Like early post- MI pericarditis, Dressler syndrome has become infrequent, likely related to limitation of infarct size by current reperfusion therapies. When it develops within the first month after MI, aspirin therapy is advised, rather than other NSAIDs, to prevent interference with scar formation, as indicated in the previous paragraph.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 210  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 38: p. 701)  

A variety of conduction disturbances can occur in acute myocardial infarction (MI). In almost all patients with first- degree atrioventricular (AV) block, the disturbance is intranodal (above the bundle of His) and generally does not require specific treatment. First- degree AV block may also be a manifestation of increased vagal tone in the setting of acute MI. Other manifestations of increased vagal tone include sinus bradycardia and hypotension that are generally responsive to atropine.  

Approximately \(90\%\) of patients with second- degree AV block admitted to coronary care units have Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) block. Mobitz type I block occurs most commonly in patients with inferior MI, is usually transient, and rarely progresses to complete AV block. It usually resolves within 72 hours after infarction and does not require specific therapy. In contrast, Mobitz type II block typically reflects conduction disease below the bundle of His, is associated with a widened QRS complex, and almost always occurs in the setting of anterior infarction. Mobitz type II block may progress to complete heart block and therefore generally justifies pacemaker placement.  

Complete AV block (third- degree AV block) may occur in either anterior or inferior infarction. Its prognosis relates to the location of the infarction. In inferior infarction, complete heart block usually evolves from first- degree and type I second- degree AV block, typically has a stable escape rhythm, and is most often transient, with spontaneous resolution. Patients with anterior infarction may develop third- degree AV block without warning; however, it is usually preceded by less advanced conduction abnormalities such as Mobitz type II block. In general, patients in this setting have unstable escape rhythms, wide QRS complexes, and a high mortality rate.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 211  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 38: p. 668)  

Overall, fibrinolytic therapy in ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction is associated with a \(15\%\) to \(20\%\) reduction in mortality at 35 days. The Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' Collaborative Group performed an overview of nine major fibrinolytic trials that each randomized more than 1000 patients. Among patients stratified by presenting ECG, patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) had the highest overall mortality, followed by patients with anterior ST- segment elevations, and then patients with inferior ST- segment elevations. The relative risk reductions with fibrinolytic therapy in patients with LBBB and anterior ST- segment elevation were both approximately \(21\%\) . Compared with patients with anterior ST- segment elevation, patients with inferior ST- segment elevation had less of a risk reduction.  

The benefits of fibrinolysis are time dependent, and there is a stepwise decrease in improvement with later therapy over the first 24 hours. Two trials (LATE and EMERAS) showed a mortality reduction in patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy 6 to 12 hours after the onset of ischemic symptoms. However, there was no benefit for individuals treated beyond that time. Patients treated within 1 to 2 hours after onset of symptoms gained the most benefit.  

Fibrinolytic trials have demonstrated that patients older than 75 years have a more modest relative risk reduction compared with individuals younger than 55 years. However, because the risk of adverse outcomes is so high for older patients, the absolute risk reductions are comparable between the age groups.  

The STREAM trial compared fibrinolysis followed by timely coronary angiography with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients early in STEMI who were not able to undergo PCI within 1 hour of first medical contact. The fibrinolytic strategy resulted in effective reperfusion and comparable 30- day outcomes as the primary PCI group but was associated with a slightly increased risk of intracranial bleeding.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 212  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 37: p. 638)  

Plaque rupture and plaque erosion are mechanisms that lead to coronary thrombosis and acute coronary syndromes. When the resulting intracoronary thrombus is only partially occlusive, ST- segment depressions or T wave inversions (or both) commonly develop. When the thrombus is completely occlusive, ST- segment elevations typically occur. In the latter setting, Q waves subsequently form in approximately \(75\%\) of patients who are not treated

<--- Page Split --->

with fibrinolysis or acute mechanical coronary revascularization.2 In the remaining \(25\%\) , other ECG manifestations may develop, including reduction of the R wave height or notching of the QRS complex.  

In the prefibrinolytic era, it was common to divide patients with myocardial infarction (MI) into those experiencing either a "Q wave MI" (now called "ST- segment elevation MI") or a "non- Q wave MI" (now called "non- ST- segment elevation MI") based on the evolution of the ECG over several days. Q wave infarction was considered to be synonymous with the pathology of a transmural infarction, whereas non- Q wave infarctions were considered to involve only the subendocardial layer. However, contemporary studies using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging indicate that the development of a Q wave on the ECG is determined more by the size of the infarct than by the depth of mural involvement.3

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 213  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 38:p.671)  

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction has been shown in large registries and randomized trials to result in higher patency rates \((93\% - 98\%\) vs. \(54\%\) ) and lower 30- day mortality rates \((5\%\) vs. \(7\%\) ) than fibrinolytic therapy. An additional advantage of PCI over fibrinolysis is a significant reduction in bleeding complications and strokes.  

When performing primary PCI, radial artery access tends to be preferred over femoral artery access based on the European Minimizing Adverse Haemorrhagic Events by Transradial Access Site and Systemic Implementation of AngioX trial, which showed a reduction in bleeding and all- cause mortality when radial access was used.2

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 214  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 38:p.705)  

Left ventricular (LV) aneurysms arise in less than \(5\%\) of patients who survive acute ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). Formation of the aneurysm is presumed to occur when intraventricular tension leads to expansion of the noncontracting, infarcted myocardial tissue. An anterior MI complicated by LV aneurysm occurs due to total occlusion of a poorly collateralized left anterior descending artery. The presence of multinessel disease, extensive collateral vessels, or a nonoccluded left anterior descending artery makes the development of an aneurysm much less likely. Aneurysms occur approximately four times more often at the apex and in the anterior wall than in the inferoposterior wall and, in general, range from 1 to 8 cm in diameter.   

True LV aneurysms, in contrast to pseudoaneurysms, rarely rupture. However, even when compared with mortality in patients having comparable LV ejection fractions, the presence of an LV aneurysm increases the rate of mortality up to six times compared with patients without aneurysm. Death in such patients is often sudden and presumed to be secondary to a high incidence of associated ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The diagnosis of an aneurysm is best made by echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or left ventriculography. The "classic" evidence of aneurysm on the ECG—persistent ST- segment elevation in the area of the infarction—actually indicates a large infarct but does not necessarily imply an aneurysmal segment.1

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 215  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 38:p.703)  

The ECG demonstrates atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate. Atrial fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction is usually transient and occurs more commonly in patients with left ventricular failure, infarct- associated pericarditis, or ischemic injury to the atria. Atrial fibrillation is more common during the first 24 hours after infarction than later. It is associated with increased mortality, in part because it occurs more frequently with extensive anterior wall infarctions. The rapid ventricular response and loss of atrial contribution to ventricular filling may lead to an important reduction in cardiac output.  

In patients who are hemodynamically stable, a beta blocker is typically appropriate to slow the ventricular rate. However, cardioversion is the treatment of choice in patients with evidence of hemodynamic decompensation. Patients with recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated.

## A (Braunwald, Ch 38:p.700)  

The rhythm displayed is accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR), which is defined as a ventricular escape rhythm with a rate between 60 and 100 beats/minute. This rhythm is sometimes referred to as "slow ventricular tachycardia" and appears in up to \(20\%\) of patients with

<--- Page Split --->

acute myocardial infarction (MI), most commonly in the first 2 days after presentation. In addition, AIVR is the most common arrhythmia noted after reperfusion of an occluded coronary artery by fibrinolytic therapy. Approximately \(50\%\) of all episodes of AIVR are initiated by a premature beat; the rest emerge during periods of sinus slowing. In general, episodes of AIVR are of short duration and may show variation in rate. Unlike more rapid forms of ventricular tachycardia, episodes of AIVR have not been found to affect prognosis in acute MI and usually do not require intervention. If AIVR is accompanied by hemodynamic compromise, treatment with atropine or atrial pacing will often suppress the rhythm.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 39: p. 718)  

Several cardiac biomarkers have been found to have prognostic value in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), independent of more established markers of cardiac necrosis such as cardiac- specific troponins. The level of C- reactive protein (CRP), an acute- phase reactant, is approximately five times higher in patients with an ACS compared with those with stable coronary disease, and patients with the highest levels of CRP have an increased risk of death, even if cardiac troponin levels are not elevated. The white blood cell count is a simpler but nonspecific marker of inflammation. Patients with unstable angina/non- ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and elevated white blood cell counts have higher mortality and recurrent MI rates. This association is independent of CRP levels.  

Elevated levels of B- type natriuretic peptide, a neuromorome released in response to ventricular wall stress, are associated with a two- to three- fold higher risk of death by 10 months.

## A (Braunwald, Ch 39: pp. 727-728)  

This patient has an indication for long- term oral anticoagulation (OAC) because of atrial fibrillation with an elevated stroke risk \(\mathrm{(CHA_2DS_2VASc}\) score is at least 5- see Answer to Question 359). Additionally, she has a new indication for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), having just undergone drug- eluting stent placement. Managing patients with indications for "triple" antithrombotic therapy presents a dilemma because of the elevated bleeding risk and uncertainty about the ischemic consequences of reducing the OAC dose or eliminating one of the antiplatelet agents. Similarly, recent studies have addressed the role of low- dose OAC in reducing future ischemic events in patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI) who do not have a separate indication for anticoagulation. How antiplatelet therapy should be modified in such patients also requires careful consideration.   

The WOEST trial randomized 573 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), who also required long- term OAC therapy, to OAC plus clopidogrel alone ("double" therapy), or OAC plus DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin ("triple" therapy). At 1 year, there was a significant reduction in bleeding events with "double" therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.50; \(P < .0001\) ). There was no increased risk of ischemic events in the "double" therapy group, though this small trial was not powered for ischemic outcomes.  

The PIONEER AF trial randomized 2124 patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI to one of three regimens: (1) "triple" therapy with warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0) plus DAPT; (2) low- dose rivaroxaban (15 mg daily) plus a \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) inhibitor without aspirin; or (3) very low- dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus a \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) inhibitor without aspirin. Patients who received reduced doses of rivaroxaban and only one antiplatelet agent had less bleeding at 12 months compared with patients receiving "triple" therapy. Importantly, the trial participants had preexisting atrial fibrillation and were not treated with approved doses of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention. The trial was not powered for ischemic events, but there were numerically more strokes in the two rivaroxaban arms than the warfarin arm. Thus, as in WOEST, the data from this trial showed reduced bleeding with "double" therapy but did not clarify whether "double" and "triple" therapies are equally effective for reduction of ischemic events.  

The randomized AUGUSTUS trial was a parallel comparison between DOAC and warfarin therapy in 4614 patients with atrial fibrillation who also experienced an acute coronary syndrome or recent PCI. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to apixaban or warfarin and were also randomized 1:1 to aspirin or placebo in addition to a \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) inhibitor. Patients randomized to placebo had less bleeding than those assigned to aspirin. While each of these trials was underpowered to assess for ischemic outcomes, the lower bleeding risk is clear with dual therapy. Current guidelines recommend only short courses of triple therapy in most circumstances, typically until hospital discharge or up to 1 month later in those at high ischemic risk, followed by anticoagulation plus \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) inhibitor therapy without aspirin over the longer term.  

Two notable trials have assessed the role of anticoagulation in the post- acute coronary syndrome (ACS) setting in patients without a separate indication for long- term OAC therapy. ATLAS ACS 2- TIMI 513 randomized 15,526 patients with a recent ACS to very low- dose rivaroxaban (2.5 or 5 mg twice daily) or placebo in addition to standard post- ACS dual antiplatelet therapy. This well- powered trial found that the addition of rivaroxaban significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke, but at a cost of increased bleeding. The GEMINI- ACS- 14 reported the results of a phase 2 trial that randomized 3037 patients with recent ACS to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus

<--- Page Split --->

single antiplatelet therapy (ticagrelor or clopidogrel) versus DAPT (aspirin plus ticagrelor or clopidogrel). The trial was powered only for bleeding events, and the rivaroxaban arm was found to be noninferior to DAPT in this regard.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 219  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 40: p. 771)  

Venous graft occlusion occurs in \(8\%\) to \(12\%\) of patients before they leave the hospital, and by 1 year post- coronary artery bypass grafting, \(15\%\) to \(30\%\) of vein grafts had become occluded.1 Graft occlusion within the first year usually involves vessel thrombosis, with or without intimal hyperplasia. After the first year, atherosclerotic changes begin to accumulate in saphenous grafts. The histologic appearance of atherosclerosis in venous bypass grafts is indistinguishable from that seen in arterial vessels. The annual occlusion rate for vessels after the first year is \(2\%\) although in grafts that are between 6 and 10 years old, an increased annual attrition rate of \(4\%\) is observed. The overall occlusion rate by 10 years is \(40\%\) to \(50\%\) . Internal mammary artery grafts have much longer durability than vein grafts, with patency rates of \(95\%\) \(88\%\) and \(83\%\) at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively.2 Aspirin \((80 - 325\mathrm{mg}\) daily, started preoperatively and continued indefinitely) and lipid- lowering therapy have favorable impacts on the development of graft disease.  

Historically, atherosclerotic progression in nongrafted arteries has occurred at a rate of \(18\%\) to \(38\%\) over the first decade, although this may be lessened by aggressive lipid- lowering regimens. The risk of disease progression in the native circulation is three to six times higher in vessels to which a graft is placed, compared with ungrafted native arteries. This is the basis for the recommendation that arteries with minimal disease not receive a bypass graft.

Myocardial stunning represents prolonged myocardial dysfunction that follows a brief episode of severe ischemia, with gradual return of contractile activity. Conversely, myocardial hibernation is the term applied to myocardial dysfunction resulting from chronic hypoperfusion.1   

Myocardial stunning affects both systolic and diastolic function and may occur in globally as well as regionally ischemic myocardium. Clinically, stunning is most frequently seen in patients recovering from ischemic arrest during cardiopulmonary bypass. It is also observed in ischemic regions adjacent to infarcted zones and in territories that are severely ischemic in patients with unstable angina. There are three likely mechanisms of myocardial stunning: (1) generation of oxygen- derived free radicals, (2) calcium overload, and (3) reduced sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium.2,3

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 221  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 39: pp. 723-724)  

Unstable angina/non- ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) is typically caused by atherosclerotic plaque disruption with formation of a platelet- rich intracoronary nonocclusive thrombus. Aspirin significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) in this setting.1 Clopidogrel is an irreversible inhibitor of the platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor. The CURE trial demonstrated that the addition of clopidogrel to standard acute coronary syndrome (ACS) therapy resulted in a \(20\%\) reduction in death, MI, or stroke. Further analysis of this trial showed that the beneficial effects became apparent within 24 hours of treatment initiation and persisted for 12 months.2  

The addition of an anticoagulant improves clinical outcomes of patients with UA/NSTEMI more than antiplatelet therapy alone.1,3 Studies of patients with unstable angina in the era before the use of dual antiplatelet regimens showed that the addition of unfractionated heparin (UFH) to aspirin reduced adverse event rates.1,3 Low- molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been compared with UFH in the setting of UA/NSTEMI. In a large meta- analysis, new or recurrent MI occurred less often with the LMWH enoxaparin, with similar rates of bleeding.4 Enoxaparin is the preferred LMWH for ACS on the basis of several clinical trials that demonstrate its efficacy, whereas the experience with other LMWHs has not been as convincing.  

The factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux was studied in patients with UA/NSTEMI in the OASIS- 5 trial and was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding and of mortality at 30 days compared with enoxaparin.5  

Another anticoagulant option, bivalirudin, is a direct thrombin inhibitor. In the ACUITY trial of patients with non- ST- segment elevation MI (most of whom received aspirin plus clopidogrel) for whom an invasive strategy was planned, bivalirudin was compared with two other antithrombotic regimens: (1) bivalirudin plus a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor, or (2) UFH or LMWH with a GP IIb/

<--- Page Split --->

Illa inhibitor. There were no differences in ischemic events between the treatment arms, but bivalirudin alone caused less bleeding than either regimen that included a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Thus, bivalirudin (with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, but without a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor) is an alternative for an early invasive strategy in NSTEMI patients, particularly if there is an increased bleeding risk.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 222  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 36: pp. 627-628)  

Preexisting collateral vessels are small \((20 - 200\mu \mathrm{m})\) vascular channels that interconnect epicardial coronary arteries. They are normally closed and nonfunctional, because there is no pressure gradient between the arteries they connect. However, with an acute coronary occlusion, the distal pressure drops suddenly, and any preexisting collateral vessels open quickly. The increased flow through these rudimentary collateral vessels triggers a maturation process that includes three stages. In the first 24 hours there is passive widening due to the increased flow. Over the next several weeks, increased flow and shear stress trigger endothelial cell activation, with subsequent inflammation and cellular proliferation with fragmentation of the basement membrane, dissolution of the extracellular matrix, and recruitment of leukocytes. Over several months, the collateral vessel wall thickens from deposition of extracellular matrix. The resultant blood vessel is a three-layer structure that is nearly indistinguishable from a normal coronary artery, with a luminal diameter as large as \(1\mathrm{mm}\) .  

Growth of the collateral circulation is triggered primarily by the severity of coronary obstruction. There is no clear evidence that exercise by itself triggers collateral formation. The reduction of myocardial ischemia in the setting of exercise training is more likely to be related to improved conditioning. Conditions that reduce endothelial production of nitric oxide, such as diabetes mellitus, may reduce the ability of collateral vessels to develop.  

In angioplasty studies, collateral vessels typically provide less than \(50\%\) of normal coronary blood flow. Nonetheless, in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction, they have been shown to decrease infarct size and contribute to improved survival. In patients with stable coronary disease, those with well- developed collateral circulations have a significantly lower rate of ischemic events.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 223  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 40: p. 765)  

Several trials have compared pharmacologic therapy to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with chronic stable angina. In most of these, PCI has resulted in greater symptomatic relief as measured by severity of angina, the need for antianginal medications, and improved quality of life. However, with respect to major cardiac events (e.g., myocardial infarction [MI] or cardiac death), the two strategies have not clearly differed. In the COURAGE trial, 2287 patients with moderately severe chronic angina were randomized to PCI plus optimal medical therapy (including aspirin, lipid lowering to a low-density lipoprotein goal of \(60 - 85\mathrm{mg / dL}\) , antianginal drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or to optimal medical therapy alone. Bare metal stents were used for PCI in the majority of patients in the PCI group. After 4.6 years of follow-up, there was no reduction in death and/or myocardial infarction in patients randomized to PCI compared with medical therapy.  

The more recent ISCHEMIA trial randomized 5179 patients with stable coronary disease and stress testing indicating at least moderate ischemia to a strategy of revascularization versus optimal medical therapy alone. Patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography to exclude left main disease. Over 3 years, patients who underwent revascularization had greater symptomatic improvement, but there was no difference in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. There was an upfront higher rate of procedural MI in patients randomized to revascularization, followed by a lower rate of spontaneous MI in follow- up.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 224  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 42: p. 807)  

Although the average rate of expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is \(0.4\mathrm{cm}\) per year, larger aneurysms tend to expand faster than smaller ones, as a consequence of Laplace's law (wall tension is proportional to the radius of the aneurysm). Once aneurysm rupture has occurred, mortality is extremely high: \(60\%\) of patients die before they reach the hospital, and \(50\%\) of those who are successfully hospitalized die perioperatively. Surveillance of asymptomatic aneurysms until the size is greater than \(5.5\mathrm{cm}\) is associated with a low rate of rupture \((\sim 1\%)\) per year. However, the 5-year risk of rupture is \(30\%\) to \(40\%\) for AAAs that are \(5.5\) to \(6.0\mathrm{cm}\) in diameter. Thus, for asymptomatic patients, current guidelines recommend repair of AAAs of \(5.0\) to \(5.5\mathrm{cm}\) or more.

<--- Page Split --->

For AAAs greater than \(4.5\mathrm{cm}\) , computed tomography is preferred over ultrasound for imaging surveillance because of greater accuracy of measurement. The Society of Vascular Surgery recommends the following frequency of imaging: for AAAs 3.0 to \(3.4\mathrm{cm}\) , every 3 years; 3.5 to \(4.4\mathrm{cm}\) , every 12 months; and 4.5 to \(5.4\mathrm{cm}\) , every 6 months. Of note, women have a higher rate of AAA rupture than men and at a smaller aneurysm diameter. Rupture is also more common among current smokers and those with hypertension.  

Clinical trials have examined the value of immediate repair of aneurysms \(4.0\mathrm{to}5.5\mathrm{cm}\) in diameter versus serial surveillance with ultrasound or computed tomographic scanning. These studies have found no mortality difference between the two strategies. Important limitations of these trials were that they enrolled almost exclusively men, and follow- up was much more intense than in general practice.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 225  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 42: pp. 827-828)  

The figure displays a contrast- enhanced chest computed tomogram showing an intimal flap ("I") due to aortic dissection. Acute aortic dissection is a medical and surgical emergency. Mortality in untreated cases exceeds \(25\%\) in the first 24 hours and \(50\%\) in the first week after presentation. Immediate medical management should focus on reduction of blood pressure, reduction of arterial \(\mathrm{dP / dt}\) (the force of left ventricular ejection), fluid resuscitation if necessary, and preparation of the patient for operative intervention if indicated. Beta blockers are the agents of choice for lowering blood pressure; labetalol is an appropriate initial choice of beta blocker because it combines blood pressure- lowering effects (alpha- and beta- blockade) with reduction of \(\mathrm{dP / dt}\) (beta- blockade). IV sodium nitroprusside can be added for additional blood pressure control if needed.  

Surgical therapy for type A (proximal) acute dissection improves survival compared with medical therapy alone. This is because progression of proximal dissection can (1) compromise flow to major vessels, including the coronary arteries, (2) rupture into the pericardium, resulting in tamponade and death, or (3) lead to severe aortic valve regurgitation. Uncomplicated type B (distal) dissections, however, can be managed with initial pharmacologic therapy alone, with a 30- day survival rate of \(92\%\) . For patients with complicated type B dissections (e.g., intractable pain or visceral ischemia), invasive intervention is necessary. Open surgical repair in such patients is associated with high mortality rates; endovascular repair is often appropriate instead.  

A small percentage of patients present with chronic aortic dissections. By surviving the acute stage these patients represent a select subset of lower- risk patients who can be managed conservatively with medical therapy regardless of the location of the dissection, unless the dissection is complicated by aneurysm, rupture, vascular compromise, or aortic regurgitation.  

When aortic regurgitation complicates acute dissection, decompression of the false lumen may be all that is required to correct the geometry of the aortic valve and restore valve competence. If abnormalities of the aortic valve leaflets prevent such repair, then aortic valve and root replacement are usually necessary.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 226  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 40: pp. 762-763)  

Ranolazine is an antianimal agent that may be used in combination with beta blockers, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers. Unlike beta blockers, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers, ranolazine exerts its anti- ischemic effect without significant effect on heart rate or blood pressure. Ranolazine inhibits the slowly inactivating component of the cardiac sodium current (late \(\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{NA}^{+}}\) ) and is therefore believed to reduce the deleterious effects of intracellular sodium and calcium overload that accompany, and may promote, myocardial ischemia.  

Clinical trials have shown that ranolazine is effective as monotherapy, or in combination with traditional antianimal agents. In studies of patients with moderate angina, ranolazine decreased the frequency of angina and need for sublingual nitroglycerin. It has not been shown to reduce major cardiac events.  

Ranolazine is generally well tolerated; its most common side effects are dizziness, headache, and constipation. Because ranolazine produces a concentration- dependent prolongation of repolarization and the QT interval, there has been concern that it may precipitate arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. However, in the MERLIN- TIMI 36 study of 6560 patients with acute coronary syndromes, there was no difference in the rates of documented dysrhythmias or sudden cardiac death in patients receiving ranolazine compared with placebo.  

Ranolazine is metabolized in the liver (primarily by CYP3A), and its use is contraindicated in patients with significant hepatic impairment.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 42: p. 807)  

The figure is an axial contrast- enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrating a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The majority of AAAs are asymptomatic.

<--- Page Split --->

On physical examination, such an aneurysm may be appreciated as a pulsatile mass extending variably from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus. The size of an aneurysm tends to be overestimated by physical examination, owing to the difficulty in distinguishing the aorta from adjacent structures. AAAs may be sensitive to palpation, especially if they are rapidly expanding.  

Ultrasonography and CT are both helpful means to diagnose and quantitate the size of AAAs. However, ultrasonography is not sufficient for planning operative repair, because it cannot define associated mesenteric and renal artery anatomy. Spiral CT with three- dimensional reconstruction provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the aortic tree. It also tends to measure aneurysms as slightly larger than by ultrasonography. Aortography, historically the gold standard for preoperative aneurysm evaluation, may actually underestimate the size of an AAA if nonopacified mural thrombus lines the wall. Magnetic resonance angiography is an alternative imaging modality that is highly accurate in determining aneurysm size and, with three- dimensional reconstruction, can define the proximal extent of disease and iliofemoral involvement in more than \(80\%\) of cases.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 228  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 39: p. 726)  

The use of platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention has been tested in multiple randomized trials, involving the full spectrum of coronary disease, from stable angina to ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). Excluding studies that used inadequate doses, the trials are consistent in demonstrating significant reductions in the composite endpoint of death, MI, and need for urgent revascularization over 30 days of follow- up. Most of this benefit is realized by patients experiencing an acute coronary syndrome and relates to reductions in periprocedural MI and the need for urgent revascularization. Several studies have concluded that patients who sustain a periprocedural MI have a worse long- term prognosis. The disadvantage of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors is an increased risk of bleeding complications.  

The reduction in clinical events with GP IIb/IIIa inhibition is typically achieved in the first 48 hours, with little separation of the event rate curves after that time. They do not appear to have any long- term effects on rates of restenosis.  

For patients with acute non- ST- segment elevation MI who have received aspirin plus a platelet P2Y12 inhibitor there is only a modest benefit of early "upstream" GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitor administration compared with provisional administration of the drug in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In a meta- analysis of 12 studies involving more than 46,000 patients, there was a small reduction in the endpoint of death or MI at 30 days, but there was no reduction in mortality alone, and there was a \(23\%\) relative increase in major bleeding. Thus, routine early administration of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor prior to transport to the cardiac catheterization laboratory is not recommended. For select high- risk patients on aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor for whom an early invasive strategy is planned, and who have a low bleeding risk, early use of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (specifically epitifibatide or tirofiban) can be considered (class IIb recommendation).

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 229  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 39: p. 734)  

Prinzmetal angina is caused by transient coronary artery vasospasm. Although the site of vasospasm may not appear to contain a significant plaque on angiography, intravascular ultrasound studies have shown that nearly all such sites have underlying atherosclerosis. Both nitrates and calcium channel blockers have been shown to be efficacious in treating and preventing attacks of Prinzmetal angina. Provocative testing with ergonovine or acetylcholine is indicated only when Prinzmetal angina is suspected and ECG evidence of transient ST- segment elevation is lacking, because these agents can cause severe prolonged coronary spasm, resulting in myocardial infarction or arrhythmias. Coronary spasm has been observed after administration of ergot derivatives, 5- fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients with isolated Prinzmetal angina generally have an excellent prognosis, with low rates of sudden cardiac death or myocardial infarction.

The figure shows atheroemboli to the left foot resulting in "blue toe syndrome." Showers of microemboli that arise from atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic or major arterial trunks lead to clinical and pathologic changes as the particulate material lodges in small arterial branches.

<--- Page Split --->

Atheromatous embolism (also called "cholesterol embolism") occurs most often after surgery involving manipulation of an atherosclerotic aorta, such as major abdominal vascular procedures, especially resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Showers of atherosclerotic emboli may also be provoked by cardiac catheterization, cardiopulmonary bypass, and intra- arterial cannulations of any type and may occasionally occur spontaneously as well. Clinical findings in this disorder may include bilateral lower extremity and/or abdominal pain, livedo reticularis, purpuric and echodymotic lesions in the lower extremities, and possibly visualization of cholesterol particles in the retinal arteries, when the proximal aorta is involved. Laboratory analysis may reveal eosinophilia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and azotemia. While imaging studies (e.g., computed tomography, magnetic resonance angiogram, or transesophageal echocardiography) may document shaggy atheromatous sources of substrate, definitive diagnosis of atheromebolism rests upon identification of cholesterol crystals on skin or muscle biopsy specimens.  

Two important recognized complications of cholesterol emboli after abdominal aortic surgery are pancreatitis and renal failure due to diffuse microinfarction of the affected organ. The resulting renal failure may be severe and irreversible. There is no specific therapy for cholesterol emboli; treatment of the resulting complications of the disorder is the cornerstone of management. The use of anticoagulants to prevent further episodes of embolization remains controversial. Antiplatelet and antilipid agents should be considered in affected patients because these therapies may prevent other cardiovascular events in this high- risk population.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 231  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 36: p. 612)  

Nitric oxide (NO) is formed in endothelial cells by the action of NO synthase on L- arginine. In this reaction, the terminal nitrogen from the guanidino group of L- arginine forms NO, and L- citrulline is produced as a by- product, which is recycled back to L- arginine. NO diffuses to neighboring smooth muscle cells, where it activates guanylate cyclase, causing an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate and smooth muscle relaxation.  

Hypoxia, thrombin, and adenosine diphosphate all stimulate endothelial NO production. Acetylcholine (ACh) induces both endothelium- dependent (i.e., NO- mediated) vasodilatation and direct smooth muscle constriction. As a result, ACh induces vasodilatation in healthy vessels, but vasoconstriction predominates in atherosclerotic vessels in which there is dysfunctional endothelium. Some vasodilators (e.g., nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, and prostacyclin) act independently of endothelial NO production and continue to produce vascular smooth muscle relaxation even in the setting of a dysfunctional endothelium.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 232  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 42: p. 831)  

Intramural hematoma (IMH) is a condition closely related to aortic dissection. It consists of a hematoma contained within the medial layer of the aortic wall with no intimal flap or false lumen. Although the pathogenesis remains uncertain, rupture of vasa vasorum has been postulated to be the initiating event. The hemorrhage occurs in the outer media and may extend into the adventitia. IMH is responsible for \(10\%\) to \(20\%\) of acute aortic syndromes. It localizes to the ascending aorta in \(30\%\) to the aortic arch in \(10\%\) and to the descending aorta in approximately \(60\%\) of affected patients.  

Intramural hematoma can be identified by computed tomography (CT), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Non- contrast- enhanced CT demonstrates a crescentic, high- attenuation area along the aortic wall without an intimal tear. Contrast CT demonstrates failure of the intramural hematoma to enhance (Fig. 2.13A). TEE shows crescentic or circumferential aortic wall thickening, an eccentric aortic lumen, and echolucency within the aortic wall, with no intimal flap (see Fig. 2.13B and C). On MRI, an intramural hematoma is identified as a crescent- shaped area of high intensity along the aortic wall. Because there is lack of communication with the aorta, aortography has a low sensitivity for this diagnosis.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 39: p. 727)  

Low- molecular- weight heparins (LMWHs) are derived from unfractionated heparin (UFH) through chemical or enzymatic depolymerization. The shorter molecules still contain the critical pentasaccharide sequence necessary for binding to and activating antithrombin (resulting in its anti- factor IIa effect), but the anti- Xa activity is much greater. They do not cause a significant rise in the activated partial thromboplastin time, and that test is not useful for clinical monitoring. Although the anticoagulation effect of LMWHs can be determined by measuring anti- Xa activity, the stable pharmacokinetics of these drugs usually renders such measurement unnecessary.  

Clearance of LMWH is reduced in patients with renal impairment, and dosage reduction is appropriate if used in such patients. Compared with UFH, treatment with LMWHs is less likely to result in type II heparin- induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, HIT antibodies can cross- react with LMWHs, and the latter should not be used when type II HIT has occurred.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 39: Fig. 39.6)  

Unstable angina and non- ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) are heterogeneous conditions with a range of possible outcomes. Clinical trials have identified subgroups of patients who are at greatest risk and who are more likely to accrue benefit from therapeutic interventions.1 High- risk individuals include those with acute rest pain or post- MI unstable angina, and those who are of advanced age or who have diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease.2,3 In addition, patients who present with unstable angina despite having been on prior chronic aspirin therapy appear to be at particularly high risk.   

The presence of ST- segment deviations of as little as \(0.05 \mathrm{mV}\) is associated with an adverse prognosis in unstable angina, and the greater the ST- segment deviation, the worse the outcome. Similarly, an elevated cardiac troponin level confers a higher risk of death.4 Increased levels of C- reactive protein (CRP) have also been related to an augmented risk of MI and death. Although CRP, as a marker of inflammation, is often elevated in acute coronary syndromes, those patients with the highest levels have worse short- and long- term outcomes.4

## C (Braunwald, Ch 43: pp. 837-838)  

The prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) varies depending on the population studied and the diagnostic methods used, ranging from \(6\%\) in people 40 years and older to \(20\%\) in those 65 years and older. The same risk factors that contribute to coronary artery disease are also associated with PAD, including cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Of these, however, hypercholesterolemia is not one of the strongest predictors, conveying only a 1.7- fold increased risk. Rather, cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus are more significantly associated, with relative risks of 4.5 and 2.7, respectively.  

Evidence of PAD has been observed even in young individuals. Data from the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth Study indicated that, in patients younger than 35 years, fatty streaks and atheroma form first in the dorsal portion of the abdominal aorta, later followed by similar lesions in the descending thoracic aorta.  

The lack of symptoms is not a reliable way to exclude the presence of PAD, because only \(10\%\) to \(30\%\) of patients years of age and older with PAD experience classic claudication.

Aortic dissection affects twice as many men as women and occurs most commonly in the sixth and seventh decades. Over \(90\%\) of patients presenting with aortic dissection complain of severe pain. The pain is usually sudden in onset, most intense at its inception, and may be described

<--- Page Split --->

as "tearing" or "ripping" in quality. The discomfort tends to migrate in association with propagation along the aortic wall. On physical examination, patients may appear to be in shock, but the measured blood pressure is typically elevated, especially in patients with distal dissection. Characteristic physical findings associated with aortic dissection, such as pulse defects, are more common in proximal dissection. New aortic regurgitation may appear with proximal dissection that extends into the aortic valve apparatus.  

Several conditions may mimic the pain of aortic dissection, including myocardial infarction, thoracic nondissecting aneurysm, mediastinal tumors, and pericarditis.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 237  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 43: pp. 840-841)  

Intermittent claudication due to peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by pain or a sense of fatigue during exercise that resolves with rest. In contrast, neurogenic pseudoclaudication (e.g., due to spinal stenosis) is associated with pain with both walking and standing. Classic physical findings in PAD include diminished or absent distal pulses, bruits over regions of stenosis, and coolness and signs of chronic low- grade ischemia such as hair loss, smooth shiny skin, and brittle nails of the affected extremity.  

Among the simpler noninvasive diagnostic tests for PAD are systolic blood pressure measurements along select segments of each extremity. A pressure gradient of greater than \(20\mathrm{mm}\) Hg between successive segments in the lower extremities or greater than \(10\mathrm{mm}\) Hg in the upper extremities is evidence of significant stenosis. A sensitive screening method for the diagnosis of PAD is the ankle/brachial index (ABI), the ratio between the ankle and brachial systolic blood pressures. An ABI value less than 1 is consistent with arterial insufficiency of the measured lower extremity and is \(95\%\) sensitive for that diagnosis. The ABI of patients with symptoms of leg claudication is typically 0.5 to 0.8, and in those with critical limb ischemia it is usually less than 0.5. Contrast angiography is the invasive gold standard for the identification of arterial stenoses. However, the resolution of gadolinium- enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) approaches that of conventional contrast- enhanced digital subtraction angiography. MRA is \(95\%\) sensitive and \(96\%\) specific for anatomic resolution of the aorta, iliac, femoral- popliteal, and tibial- peroneal arteries.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 43: p. 849)  

The patient described in this question is at elevated risk of future events across arterial territories, including in the coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial beds. In the COMPASS trial, 27,359 patients with either stable coronary disease or stable peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were randomized to aspirin alone, rivaroxaban \(2.5\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily plus aspirin, or rivaroxaban \(5\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily without aspirin. The trial was stopped early by the independent monitoring committee for overwhelming efficacy of the rivaroxaban \(2.5\mathrm{mg}\) BID plus aspirin arm. There was a \(24\%\) reduction in the primary end point of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction, and lower rates of major adverse limb events. There was no difference in primary cardiovascular outcomes in the rivaroxaban- only group compared to those taking aspirin alone; major bleeding was more common in the groups that included rivaroxaban.   

These findings were extended in the VOYAGER PAD trial, which randomized 6564 patients with PAD who had undergone prior revascularization to rivaroxaban \(2.5\mathrm{mg}\) BID plus aspirin or aspirin plus placebo. Patients assigned to rivaroxaban had a \(15\%\) lower rate of acute limb ischemia, major amputation, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes at 3 years. There was an increase in major bleeding in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group, but no increase in intracranial or fatal bleeding. These trials support the combination of low- dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin to reduce cardiovascular and limb complications in patients with PAD, who are not at high bleeding risk.  

Trials assessing the routine addition of warfarin to antiplatelet therapy in patients with PAD have demonstrated an increase in major bleeding without a reduction of cardiovascular endpoints.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 239  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 40: p. 760)  

Nitrates are important agents in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. They directly relax vascular smooth muscle by activating intracellular guanylate cyclase, thus causing an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which triggers smooth muscle relaxation. Because nitrates act directly on smooth muscle, they do not require an intact endothelium to secrete nitric oxide as a secondary messenger. The vasodilating effect of nitrates is manifest in both arteries and veins but predominates in the venous circulation. The decrease in venous tone lessens venous return to the heart and thereby reduces preload and ventricular dimensions, which in turn diminishes wall tension. In addition to decreasing wall tension and myocardial oxygen demand, nitrates may also increase oxygen supply by dilating coronary arteries. Such dilatation can be effected in vessels containing atherosclerosis, presumably because pathologic atherosclerotic changes are eccentric

and normal vascular smooth muscle, which can respond to nitrates, is present in a portion of the plaque.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 240  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 37: p. 648)  

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) may be responsible for up to \(25\%\) to \(30\%\) of myocardial infarctions in women under 50 years of age; it is much less common in men. This condition appears to arise from medial dissection or rupture in vasa vasorum, unrelated to instrumentation, atherosclerotic plaque, or trauma, that leads to coronary occlusion by the resultant intramural hemorrhage or dissection flap. There may be an underlying arteriopathy, such as fibromuscular dysplasia.  

Management of SCAD requires careful individualization, and there are no large randomized controlled trials to guide decision- making. In general, for patients with symptom resolution and preserved coronary flow, an initial conservative strategy is preferred because of a high rate of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) complications in this condition. Nonetheless, for patients with persistent ischemia or shock, revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting should be considered. For most patients with SCAD, it is appropriate to investigate underlying causes of arterial fragility, such as fibromuscular dysplasia.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 241  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 26: p. 489)  

Renovascular disease is common and can contribute to hypertension and progressive deterioration of kidney function. One option for management of renal artery stenosis (RAS) is percutaneous renal artery angioplasty and stenting, and the technical success rate of these procedures exceeds \(95\%\) . The use of stents has greatly improved the procedural outcome even for ostial lesions and reduces restenosis rates. Clinical trial data of patients with unilateral RAS have demonstrated that surgical revascularization and percutaneous angioplasty lead to similar degrees of blood pressure improvement and stabilization of renal function.  

Although successful percutaneous treatment of atherosclerotic RAS commonly improves blood pressure, at least modestly, complete resolution of hypertension is unusual, because many affected patients have accompanying essential hypertension or intrinsic renal disease. As a result, only approximately two- thirds of patients who undergo successful intervention have a reduced requirement for antihypertensive medications.  

Furthermore, studies have not demonstrated superior benefit of percutaneous intervention compared with medical antihypertensive therapy alone. The ASTRAL trial prospectively randomized 806 patients with atherosclerotic renal artery disease to either percutaneous revascularization or medical therapy, and the revascularization group did not experience superior clinical effect as measured by progression of renal dysfunction, blood pressure levels, or cardiovascular events. Among the patients assigned to percutaneous revascularization, there were serious periprocedural complications, including cholesterol embolism leading to gangrene and toe or limb amputation. In the CORAL trial, 947 patients with atherosclerotic RAS and hypertension or chronic kidney disease were randomized to renal artery stenting or medical therapy. There was no benefit in terms of clinical outcomes with renal artery stenting. A criticism of these trials is that the enrolled patients had only modest RAS severity.   

Thus, at present, renal artery revascularization is a consideration mostly for RAS patients with severe refractory hypertension of recent onset, intolerance of medical therapies, recurrent associated flash pulmonary edema, or progression of renal insufficiency attributed to this condition.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 242  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 40: p. 777)  

The syndrome of angina- like chest pain in the presence of a normal coronary arteriogram encompasses a heterogeneous population that includes patients with true heart disease as well as those with noncardiac chest pain. When associated with clinical and ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia, the syndrome is known as INOCA (Ischemia with No Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease). Although most studies have failed to reveal consistent biochemical evidence of ischemia, such as an elevation of myocardial lactate with exercise, evidence of decreased perfusion may be found in many of these patients by exercise testing or scintigraphy using single- photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography. The incidence of coronary calcification on multislice computed tomography is higher than that of normal subjects but lower than that of patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Some patients with this syndrome have evidence of endothelial and microvascular dysfunction, with inadequate vasodilator reserve and an exaggerated response to vasoconstrictor stimuli. Increased sensitivity to pain has also been associated with this condition.  

Largely because of the heterogeneous population, studies of potential treatments have given varying and often contradictory results. Nitrates have been shown to both improve and reduce exercise tolerance. Beta- blockers may be effective who show signs of increased sympathetic activity (e.g., hypertension, tachycardia). Calcium channel

<--- Page Split --->

blockers and ranolazine have not demonstrated consistent benefit. In addition, some patients appear to benefit from antidepressant drugs. Overall, the cardiac prognosis of patients with this syndrome is very good and better than that of patients with obstructive CAD. Notably, however, in the Women's Ischemic Syndrome Evaluation study, women with angina and nonobstructive CAD who had persistent symptoms demonstrated more than a two- fold increase in future cardiovascular events.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 243  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 42: pp. 809-810)  

For patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and appropriate anatomy, endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a less invasive approach than standard open surgery. The endograft is introduced percutaneously or via arterial cutdown into the femoral artery and maneuvered to the involved aortic segment. Anatomic constraints limit the use of EVAR, but reported primary success rates for aneurysm exclusion in carefully chosen patients have ranged from \(78\%\) to \(99\%\) . An endoleak (persistent flow into the aneurysmal sac external to the endograft after it has been deployed) is a complication of EVAR that occurs in approximately \(25\%\) of patients and leaves the patient at risk for aneurysm rupture.  

Randomized trials have shown a lower 30- day mortality for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm compared with an open surgical procedure. Additional trials have begun to define the long- term outcomes of EVAR. In the United Kingdom Endovascular Aneurysm Repair 1 trial, 1252 patients with a large \((\geq 5.5 \text{cm})\) AAA were randomized to endovascular or open operative repair. The 30- day mortality rate favored endovascular repair, but there was no difference in mortality over the long term (median follow- up of 6 years), and the endovascular procedure was associated with higher rates of complications, need for reintervention, and increased cost. Similarly, an analysis of 79,932 Medicare patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm showed that EVAR resulted in lower perioperative mortality and complications than open surgical repair, but at 8- year follow- up mortality rates were the same, and EVAR- treated patients required more aneurysm- related reinterventions.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 244  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 43: p. 848)  

Treatment of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is multidisciplinary. Currently available drug therapy is not as effective as agents used to treat chronic coronary artery disease. Pentoxifylline is a xanthine derivative, and its beneficial effects in PAD are believed to be mediated by its hemorheologic properties, including an increase in red blood cell flexibility, as well as by its anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects. Several studies have shown that pentoxifylline increases both the walking distance to initial claudication symptoms and the absolute distance able to be traveled. Cilostazol acts by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 3, thereby augmenting cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, and it has been shown to enhance vasodilatation and inhibit platelet aggregation. Clinical trials have demonstrated that cilostazol improves walking distances and quality of life. It should not be prescribed to patients with heart failure because other drugs with similar mechanisms of action decrease survival in that population.  

Supervised exercise rehabilitation significantly improves symptoms of claudication. Meta- analyses have found that walking programs increase maximum walking distances in patients with PAD by \(50\%\) to \(200\%\) .  

Revascularization options in patients with PAD include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and bypass surgery. PTA of the iliac artery results in patency rates of \(60\%\) to \(80\%\) at 4 years. This figure improves further with the use of stenting. Aortobifemoral bypass surgery results in 10- year patency rates of nearly \(90\%\) .

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 245  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 42: p. 824; Fig. 42.20; see also Answer to Question 225)  

The immediate therapeutic goals in the management of aortic dissection are reduction of blood pressure and vascular wall stress and controlling pain. Current guidelines recommend initiating an intravenous beta blocker (to reduce the rise in force of left ventricular contraction, \(\mathrm{dP / dt}\) ) such as labetalol. If systolic blood pressure remains greater than \(120 \text{mm Hg}\) , the addition of an intravenous vasodilator (e.g., sodium nitroprusside) is recommended to further lower arterial pressure. Such an approach allows for temporary stabilization in appropriate surgical candidates and is the treatment of choice for those patients in whom surgery is not indicated. The appearance of a life-threatening complication such as aortic rupture, acute aortic regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, or compromise of a vital organ mandates immediate surgical intervention.

<--- Page Split --->

As indicated in the Answer to Question 225, surgical repair is the standard of therapy for type A (proximal) acute dissection, because it has been shown to improve survival. Conversely, patients with uncomplicated type B (distal) aortic dissection can most often be safely managed with initial pharmacologic therapy alone.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 246  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 31: p. 556)  

Diabetes is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis of the coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arteries, and the prevalence of this condition is increasing in both developed and developing countries. According to the American Diabetes Association, diagnostic criteria for the presence of diabetes include a fasting plasma glucose concentration greater than \(126~\mathrm{mg / dL}\) or a hemoglobin A1c level of \(6.5\%\) or more.  

Aggressive and comprehensive risk factor modification reduces adverse cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients. In addition to glycemic control, key targets for intervention include hypertension, cigarette smoking, and modification of abnormal lipid levels. A strategy of anti- . ipidemic therapy in diabetic patients without markedly increased cholesterol levels has been tested in several trials. In the CARDS study, diabetic subjects without established coronary disease or high cholesterol levels were randomized to atorvastatin \(10\mathrm{mg}\) daily or placebo. After 4 years, atorvastatin reduced major cardiovascular events by \(37\%\) and total mortality by \(27\%\) . Baseline lipid levels did not predict benefit from statin therapy: patients with lower than median low- density lipoprotein at entry received the same advantage from statin therapy as did patients with higher cholesterol levels.  

Patients with type 2 diabetes often display reduced serum high- density lipoprotein (HDL), increased triglycerides, and near- normal low- density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Bifrate therapy (e.g., gemfibrozil or fenofibrate) is effective at reducing triglycerides and raising HDL cholesterol, but the impact of such therapy has not been shown to be beneficial on cardiovascular outcomes in diabetics. In the FIELD study, 9795 middle- aged type 2 diabetics were randomized to placebo or fenofibrate. Over 5 years, fenofibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of the primary outcome of coronary events, and there was a trend toward higher total mortality. Similarly, in the ACCORD trial, the addition of fenofibrate to statin therapy did not improve cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetics over 4.7 years of follow- up. In distinction, as described in the answer to Question 182, the REDUCE- IT trial showed that icosapent ethyl (a highly purified form of eicosapentaenoic acid) significantly reduced cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke in patients with established CAD, or in diabetics with other atherosclerotic risk factors, who had a baseline fasting triglyceride level of 135 to \(499\mathrm{mg / dL}\) on statin therapy.  

The rate of diabetes development can be reduced by interventions that target undesired lifestyles. In the Diabetes Prevention Program, 3234 nondiabetic persons with impaired glucose tolerance were randomized to an intense lifestyle- modification program (with goals of \(\geq 7\%\) weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week), to standard lifestyles, or to metformin. After an average follow- up of 2.8 years, the incidence of diabetes was significantly reduced in both the intense lifestyle group and those taking metformin, but more so in the intense lifestyle group (reductions of \(58\%\) and \(31\%\) respectively).

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 247  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 36: p. 609)  

Blood flow to the myocardium is determined by the perfusion pressure gradient and the vascular resistance of the myocardial bed. The latter is influenced by extrinsic forces (e.g., compression by the myocardium) and by intrinsic metabolic, neural, and humoral factors. Intramyocardial pressure is determined primarily by the ventricular pressure throughout the cardiac cycle. Because the ventricular pressure is so much higher in systole than it is in diastole, myocardial compressive forces acting on intramyocardial vessels are greater during this phase. Therefore, the subendocardium, which is subject to higher systolic pressures, receives less systolic flow than the subepicardium. However, total flow is greater in the subendocardium than the subepicardium because there is enhanced basal vasodilatation in the former as a result of higher metabolic demands.  

Actions that reduce the perfusion pressure gradient during diastole, when the majority of subendocardial flow occurs, lower the ratio of subendocardial to subepicardial flow and may cause the subendocardium to become ischemic. Thus, an increase in ventricular end-diastolic pressure or a decrease in diastolic filling time (e.g., during tachycardia) can reduce subendocardial flow disproportionately. Because the subendocardium has lower basal vascular tone, the reserve for vasodilatation is less than in the subepicardium. Therefore, as perfusion is reduced, the deeper layers of the myocardium become ischemic sooner than the more superficial ones.

As described in the Answer to Question 220, myocardial stunning represents myocardial dysfunction that persists after a period of severe ischemia, with gradual return of contractile activity. Molecular mechanisms include the generation of oxygen- derived free radicals, calcium overload, and reduced sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium. Stunned myocardium does respond to inotropic therapy, hence the appropriateness of transient inotropic support in some patients after myocardial infarction until the adjacent stunned myocardium recovers contractile function.  

In contrast, hibernating myocardium refers to myocardial dysfunction that results from chronically decreased coronary blood flow, a condition that can be reversed with revascularization. Histopathologic studies reveal both myocyte dedifferentiation and apoptosis, suggesting that irreversible changes may occur if revascularization is not undertaken.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 249  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 39: pp.714-715)  

Approximately \(15\%\) of patients who present with symptoms consistent with unstable angina are found to have no significant coronary artery disease on angiography. Approximately one- third of such patients present with impaired coronary flow, suggesting the presence of microvascular dysfunction. The short- term prognosis is excellent in this situation.  

For patients with a clear culprit lesion, the responsible plaque is typically eccentric, with overhanging edges consistent with a disrupted atherosclerotic locus. Intravascular ultrasonography in patients with unstable angina often demonstrates soft echolucent lesions (thin fibrous cap and lipid- rich core) and fewer calcified lesions compared with patients with chronic stable angina.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 250  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 40: p.774)  

Comparison of outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with those of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a "moving target," because new technologies for both strategies continue to improve outcomes and reduce complications. Nonetheless, randomized trials comparing the two approaches have yielded consistent results. For the majority of patients, there is no difference in the rates of subsequent death or myocardial infarction. Such similar outcomes have been observed in patients with single- vessel coronary artery disease (including left anterior descending coronary artery disease), as well as in patients with multivessel disease. There is, however, consistent evidence that patients who undergo PCI are more likely to have recurrent angina or require additional subsequent interventional procedures.   

The SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) trial, performed between 2005 and 2007, was a major randomized clinical study with long- term follow- up comparing CABG to drug- eluting stent (DES) implantation. It confirmed that CABG and PCI survival rates are similar in patients with relatively uncomplicated coronary disease, but for those with the most complex and widespread CAD, CABG appeared to offer a survival advantage. In this trial, 1800 patients with multivessel disease were randomized to CABG or DES implantation. At 12 months, the rates of death or myocardial infarction were similar between the two groups, but the stroke rate was higher in the CABG patients. At 5 years of follow- up, all- cause mortality and stroke rates did not differ, but the occurrence of myocardial infarction or need for repeat revascularization was higher among the PCI patients. Post hoc analysis revealed that, at 3 and 5 years of follow- up, patients with the most severe and complex CAD had more adverse cardiac outcomes, including worsened survival, with PCI compared with CABG.  

Among diabetic patients with multivessel disease, bypass surgery has also been shown to offer improved survival compared with PCI. For example, the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation trial was a large comparison of the two treatment strategies among symptomatic patients with angina whose coronary anatomy was deemed suitable for revascularization by either technique (i.e., two- or three- vessel disease, but not left main stenosis). In this study, patients with diabetes and multivessel disease showed significantly improved survival with CABG compared with coronary angioplasty. These findings were confirmed in the Future REvascularization Evaluation in patients with Diabetes Mellitus study. This trial compared CABG and PCI with DESs in 1900 diabetic patients with multivessel disease and found that CABG reduced all- cause mortality and the incidence of myocardial infarction.

Multiple studies have demonstrated the benefits of statin therapy in primary and secondary prevention of coronary

disease. Most of the early studies compared a moderate dose of statin with placebo therapy. Subsequent trials examined the role of high- dose statins and more aggressive lipid lowering in patients with established coronary artery disease. For example, the Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering trial found that treatment with high- dose atorvastatin \((80\mathrm{mg / day})\) over 4 months reduced cardiac events by \(16\%\) compared with placebo.2  

The Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy- Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (PROVE IT- TIMI) 22 trial compared high- dose atorvastatin \((80\mathrm{mg / day})\) versus moderate- dose pravastatin \((40\mathrm{mg / day})\) begun within 10 days of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and found that the risk of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization was reduced by \(25\%\) by the more intense regimen, with a significant difference seen within 30 days of randomization.3 The Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering study compared similar doses of pravastatin and high- dose atorvastatin and, using intravascular ultrasound, demonstrated reduction in atheroma size in the patients randomized to the high- dose atorvastatin over 18 months of therapy.4  

Not all studies have demonstrated an advantage of high- dose statin therapy over less intense regimens. In the Aggrastat to Zocor (A to Z- TIMI 21) trial, patients with ACS were randomized to an initial therapy of moderate- dose simvastatin \((40\mathrm{mg / day})\) for 1 month, followed by high- dose \((80\mathrm{mg / day})\) therapy versus placebo for 4 months, followed by low- dose simvastatin \((20\mathrm{mg / day})\) . After 2 years of follow- up, there was no difference in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular events. However, myopathy (creatine kinase \(>10\) times the upper limit of normal) occurred in nine patients receiving high- dose simvastatin versus one patient receiving the less intensive regimen \((P = .02)\) .5 Furthermore, the SEARCH trial showed that the incidence of major vascular events was no lower in those randomized to simvastatin \(80\mathrm{mg}\) daily compared with patients receiving \(20\mathrm{mg}\) daily.6

## B (Braunwald, Ch 39: pp. 723-724)  

Antiplatelet agents act at a number of sites to block platelet aggregation. Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) that impairs the formation of thromboxane \(\mathrm{A}_2\) , a potent mediator of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Because platelets are incapable of new COX synthesis, the effect is permanent for the 7- to 10- day lifetime of the affected platelet. Other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may prevent acetylation of COX by aspirin. For example, there is evidence that concomitant administration of some nonselective NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may inhibit the effects of aspirin on COX and reduce aspirin's antiplatelet efficacy.2   

Clopidogrel and prasugrel are theinopyridine derivatives that block the adenosine diphosphate-dependent pathway of platelet activation. Both result in irreversible blockade of the \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) ADP receptor and therefore have long effective half- lives.1 Prasugrel is a more potent inhibitor of the \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) receptor and has favorable pharmacokinetics with a more rapid onset of action than clopidogrel. In the TRITON- TIMI 38 trial of patients with moderate- to- high risk acute coronary syndromes with planned percutaneous coronary intervention, those who received prasugrel had a lower composite rate of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke compared with those who received clopidogrel, but were at an increased risk of major bleeding.3  

Cilostazol is a potent inhibitor of platelet phosphodiesterase- 3 that has vasodilator properties. It has been shown to benefit individuals with intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial disease (see Answer to Question 244).

The SAVE study was the first trial to demonstrate that angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy reduces mortality in patients with ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction. Many subsequent studies have demonstrated a similar and consistent benefit of these agents at reducing cardiovascular endpoints after myocardial infarction (MI).1 This has been shown with short- term use (4- 6 weeks) in all patients with MI and in long- term treatment of patients with depressed left ventricular systolic function after MI. Analysis of short- term trials indicates that one- third of the mortality benefit occurs within the first 2 days of ACE inhibitor therapy.2  

Two studies, OPTIMAAL and VALIANT, evaluated the efficacy of the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) losartan and valsartan, respectively, versus the ACE inhibitor captopril in MI patients. In OPTIMAAL, losartan was better tolerated, but there was a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival with captopril. In the VALIANT trial, captopril and valsartan resulted in similar clinical outcomes. The combination of valsartan plus captopril did not offer any advantage of either drug used alone.3 Thus, in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors, an ARB is an adequate substitute, but there does not appear to be an advantage of combining the two together in post- MI patients.  

The EPHESUS trial examined the role of the selective aldosterone inhibitor eplerenone in patients with MI

complicated by left ventricular dysfunction. During 16 months of follow- up, this agent resulted in a \(15\%\) relative risk reduction in mortality compared with standard treatment. Such therapy must be prescribed with care, because significant hyperkalemia was more common among the patients treated with eplerenone.4

This history and angiogram are consistent with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), also known as Buerger disease. This disease of small and medium arteries of the arms and legs predominantly affects young individuals (onset usually age \(< 45\) years) and is almost always associated with tobacco use.12 TAO is more prevalent in Asia than in North America and Europe, and greater than \(75\%\) of affected patients are men. The most common presentation includes resting pain of the feet, calves, hands, or forearms, and digital ulcerations are frequently observed. Raynaud phenomenon and superficial thrombophlebitis are common.  

Angiography of affected limbs in patients with TAO demonstrates segmental occlusion of small and medium vessels, the absence of atherosclerosis, and corkscrew collateral vessels bypassing the occlusions.  

Smoking cessation is the most important therapy for this condition. Patients who continue to smoke face a \(40\%\) to \(45\%\) risk of future amputation. There is no evidence that statin therapy is beneficial and there is usually no role for vascular surgery because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the generally poor distal vasculature.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 26: pp. 497-498)  

The incidence of hypertensive emergencies is falling as a result of widespread treatment of chronic hypertension. In addition to a marked rise in blood pressure, a hypertensive crisis is associated with end- organ damage. Acute retinal effects include hemorrhages, exudates, or papilledema (termed accelerated-malignant hypertension). Hypertensive encephalopathy is manifest by headache, irritability, confusion, somnolence, stupor, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and eventually coma. In previously normotensive individuals, encephalopathy may occur at a lower blood pressure than in those with a history of chronic hypertension. The pathogenesis of hypertensive encephalopathy is thought to involve failure of cerebral autoregulation, with dilatation of cerebral arterioles leading to excessive cerebral blood flow and damage to the arteriolar wall with increased vascular permeability.   

Other clinical features of hypertensive crises include renal insufficiency with proteinuria, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, congestive heart failure, and nausea and vomiting. Patients who have elevated blood pressure and any end- organ manifestations of hypertensive emergency require rapid therapeutic intervention, usually with parenteral drug therapy.

The transesophageal echocardiogram shows the proximal ascending aorta in long- axis view in a patient with proximal aortic dissection. The aortic valve, and true (T) and false (F) lumina are identified. The linear shadow (labeled "I") is an intimal flap. The major predisposing factor for aortic dissection is cystic medial degeneration. Of the conditions that promote cystic medial degeneration, age and hypertension are the two most common. Hereditary abnormalities of connective tissue—Marfan syndrome, Loeys- Dietz syndrome, and Ehlers- Danlos syndrome—are all associated with cystic medial degeneration, as is bicuspid aortic valve.  

Approximately half of all dissections in women younger than 40 years occur in association with pregnancy, most commonly in the third trimester or early postpartum period.1 Cocaine, but not heroin, use has also been associated with aortic dissection.2

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 258  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 38: p. 694; see also Answer to Question 207)  

Right ventricular infarction (RVI) frequently accompanies inferior left ventricular infarction and may be recognized by a characteristic clinical and hemodynamic pattern. Hypotension or a marked hypotensive response to nitroglycerin or diuretics in patients with inferior infarction suggests the diagnosis of RVI. The hemodynamic picture of this condition is similar to that of pericardial disease and may include elevated right ventricle (RV) filling pressure, a steep right atrial \(y\) descent, and a "square root sign" in the RV pressure tracing. The Kussmaul sign may also be present. The presence of unexplained systemic hypoxemia in the setting of RVI suggests the possibility of right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale because of the elevated right-sided pressures. The placement of right-sided precordial ECG leads is helpful in establishing the diagnosis of RVI. ST- segment elevation in lead \(\mathrm{V_4R}\) is specific and sensitive for this diagnosis.  

Because left- sided filling pressures are dependent on the transport of blood from the right heart, RVI may reduce left ventricular preload and result in a reduction in left ventricular stroke volume and systemic hypotension. Thus, initial therapy for hypotension in RVI should usually include volume expansion, and diuretics should generally be avoided.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 259  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 43: Fig. 43.4)  

Segmental pressure measurements and determination of the ankle/brachial index (ABI) are easily obtained and very useful noninvasive methods to evaluate symptoms of peripheral arterial disease. To measure segmental pressures, pneumatic cuffs are placed over the upper and lower thigh, calf, and ankle and above the metatarsal area of the foot, then systolic pressures are measured using a Doppler probe. In the iliac and femoral arteries, a \(70\%\) to \(90\%\) decrease in the cross- sectional area of the artery must be present to create a pressure gradient. A gradient greater than \(20\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) between successive levels of the cuffs is evidence of a significant stenosis.  

Measurement of the ABI is an even simpler screening tool that represents the ratio of the systolic pressure at the ankle to that of the brachial artery, typically measured using a Doppler flow probe. A normal ABI is greater than 1.0. An ABI of less than 0.9 is very sensitive for angiographic evidence of an arterial stenosis. Patients with critical limb ischemia typically have an ABI of less than 0.5. The sensitivity of the ABI is decreased in severely calcified arteries because such vessels do not compress and therefore have spuriously high systolic pressure readings.  

The patient in this case has segmental pressure measurements consistent primarily with significant stenoses in the right iliac and common femoral arteries.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 260  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 41: p. 802)  

Restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is due to the local proliferation of neointimal tissue. Factors that increase rates of restenosis include small vessels, long lesions, the presence of diabetes, and mechanical stent issues, including underexpansion (see Braunwald 12e eTable 41.15). In- stent restenosis (ISR) is a common problem: approximately \(15\%\) of PCIs in the United States each year are performed as treatment for this condition. This number likely underestimates the true prevalence, however, as only patients who undergo repeat PCI are captured. In a post hoc analysis of revascularization procedures performed during the FOURIER trial, greater than \(25\%\) of subjects undergoing revascularization were found to have at least one ISR lesion greater than \(50\%\) .2  

The optimal treatment of ISR is not known. If there is a single layer of prior stenting, the lesion is typically treated with placement of a new drug- eluting stent. Other strategies are being studied, including angioplasty with a drug- eluting balloon without new stent insertion. Recurrent ISR in which multiple layers of stent are already present is a clinical challenge and is often treated with coronary brachytherapy (beta radiation) to impede the proliferative process.3

interventions. Currently available systems include those that slowly release sirolimus, paclitaxel, zotarolimus, or everolimus. Sirolimus is a cytostatic inhibitor of neointimal growth. In the RAVEL study, the first large study comparing a DES with a bare metal stent, there was no angiographic restenosis in the patients randomized to the sirolimus- eluting group. The larger SIRIUS trial demonstrated a \(4.1\%\) restenosis rate compared with \(16.6\%\) in the bare- metal stent group. Paclitaxel stabilizes microtubules and prevents cell division. The TAXUS- IV trial, a large, randomized study of bare metal versus paclitaxel- eluting stents, found that the latter exhibited a marked reduction of subsequent in- stent stenosis. The target vessel revascularization at 9 months was reduced from \(11.3\%\) to \(3\%\) . Everolimus and zotarolimus are rapamycin analogs with immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties. Everolimus was compared with paclitaxel in the SPIRIT IV trial of patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Those who received the everolimus- eluting stent had reduced target lesion failure over 2 years of follow- up. Zotarolimus- eluting stents were not shown to reduce target lesion revascularization (TLR) or late stent thrombosis more than sirolimus; rates of TLR were similar when zotarolimus was compared with paclitaxel- eluting stents.  

Because a DES impairs endothelial regrowth after balloon expansion, extended use of aspirin plus an oral P2Y12 platelet receptor antagonist (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) is required after implantation to prevent thrombosis. Rare cases of life- threatening late stent thrombosis have been reported many months or years after DES implantation, particularly when dual antiplatelet therapy has been discontinued prematurely. A large, randomized trial compared stent thrombosis at 3 years between zotarolimus and sirolimus DES and found no difference in the occurrence of late thrombosis. Current guidelines recommend at least 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy after DES implantation.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 262  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 32: pp. 579-580)  

A program of regular exercise is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk, presumably because of its beneficial effects on traditional risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Regular exercise also appears to contribute to a less prothrombotic state by altering the activity of the fibrinolytic system: exercise reduces plasma fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 levels and increases tissue plasminogen activator levels. In addition, although sudden exercise in chronically sedentary individuals may increase platelet activation, a program of regular exercise has the beneficial opposite effect.  

Heart rate variability is a measure of autonomic function that is dependent on the relation between parasympathetic and sympathetic tone. Reduced heart rate variability is associated with an elevated risk of coronary artery disease and mortality. Regular exercise reduces parasympathetic tone and increases (i.e., improves) heart rate variability.  

Exercise has been shown to improve the impaired endothelial- dependent vasodilatation typical of patients with coronary artery disease or coronary risk factors, likely because of increased expression of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and NO production. Exercise also tends to produce beneficial changes in the lipid profile, including higher levels of high- density lipoprotein and lower levels of low- density lipoprotein and triglycerides.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 263  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 36: pp. 579-580)  

The three major components of myocardial oxygen demand \(\mathrm{MVO_2}\) are heart rate, myocardial contractile state, and wall tension. In turn, wall tension during systole is proportional to the aortic pressure and intraventricular volume. An increase in any of these parameters results in augmented myocardial oxygen consumption.  

Heart rate is generally the most important determinant of \(\mathrm{MVO_2}\) and the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. For example, during tachycardia \(\mathrm{MVO_2}\) increases and, at the same time, coronary oxygen supply may suffer, because the shortened diastolic filling period tends to reduce subendocardial coronary blood flow.  

The circulating content of hemoglobin is an important determinant of myocardial oxygen supply, not \(\mathrm{MVO_2}\)

chronic renal disease are prone to hyperkalemia because of the associated syndrome of hypereminemic hypoadlosteronism, combined with impaired insulin secretion, both of which increase the serum potassium concentration. Thus, supplemental potassium and potassium- sparing diuretics must be used with caution in such patients.  

Although tomatoes and bananas are rich sources of potassium, it would be unusual for a normal diet to cause such a marked rise in potassium. Urinary tract infections may increase potassium in the setting of worsened renal function (which was not observed in this patient). Primary hyperaldosteronism and Cushing syndrome are more likely to cause hypokalemia than hyperkalemia.

Prasugrel, like clopidogrel, is a thienopyridine derivative that impairs platelet aggregation through irreversible inhibition of the \(\mathrm{P2Y_{12}}\) receptor. Active metabolites of prasugrel render it 10 times more potent an antiplatelet agent than clopidogrel. In the TRITON- TIMI 38 trial, 13,608 patients with acute coronary syndromes for whom percutaneous coronary intervention was planned were randomized to either prasugrel (60 mg loading dose, followed by \(10\mathrm{mg}\) daily) or clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, followed by \(75\mathrm{mg}\) daily). Over 15 months of follow- up, prasugrel reduced the outcomes of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke by \(19\%\) . In patients who received stents, prasugrel also reduced the risk of stent thrombosis by half. However, prasugrel was associated with an increased rate of fatal bleeding compared with clopidogrel (0.4 vs. \(0.1\%\) , \(P = .002\) ). Bleeding complications were greatest in the elderly (≥75 years), patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, and those who weighed less than \(60\mathrm{kg}\) , so that prasugrel should be avoided in such patients.
