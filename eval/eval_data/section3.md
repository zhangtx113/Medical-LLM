## QUESTION 387

D. Atrial inhibited pacing is an appropriate mode of pacing for patients with AV nodal dysfunction  
E. Dual-chamber pacing and sensing with inhibition and tracking (DDD) is the preferred mode of pacing for patients in atrial fibrillation  

## QUESTION 388  

Which of the following statements regarding cardiac pacemakers is NOT correct?

C. Cellular telephones do not cause clinically important pacemaker interference during normal use  
D. Right bundle branch block is the expected electrocardiographic pattern during right ventricular pacing  
E. Pseudofusion on the surface ECG is identified by an appropriately timed pacing stimulus that does not alter the morphology of a superimposed intrinsic QRS

## QUESTION 390  

Which of the following is NOT associated with the electrocardiographic abnormality displayed in Fig. 3.18?  

A. An absence of underlying structural heart disease in most adults  
B. Beneficial response to treatment with verapamil  
C. An association with Ebstein anomaly

E. A right posterosepetal pathway  

## QUESTION 391  

A 65- year- old diabetic man with a history of myocardial infarction presents for evaluation. He is known to have a left ventricular ejection fraction of \(30\%\) with anterior wall hypokinesis. He is comfortable at rest but reports dyspnea with simple household activities and cannot ascend a flight of stairs without stopping to catch his breath. He does not describe chest discomfort, and there is no evidence of reversible ischemia by exercise scintigraphy. His current medical regimen includes carvedilol \(25\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily, sacubitril/valsartan \(49 / 51\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily, furosemide \(20\mathrm{mg}\) daily, spironolactone \(25\mathrm{mg}\) daily, and empagliflozin \(10\mathrm{mg}\) daily. His physical examination reveals blood pressure of \(100 / 58\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) , heart rate of 68 beats/minute, normal jugular venous pressure, and clear lungs to auscultation. The apical cardiac impulse is laterally displaced toward the anterior axillary line. On auscultation there is a normal \(\mathrm{S}_1\) , paradoxically split \(\mathrm{S}_2\) , an apical \(\mathrm{S}_3\) gallop, and a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiates to the axilla. There is no peripheral edema. His ECG is shown in Fig. 3.19. Which of the following is the most appropriate approach to device therapy in this patient?  

A. No device implantation is indicated  
B. Implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator is warranted  
C. Implantation of a combined cardiac resynchronization-defibrillator system is appropriate

D. Refer the patient for echocardiography to assess dys-synchrony and, if present, implant a cardiac resynchronization-defibrillator  
E. Implantation of a cardiac-resynchronization pacemaker without defibrillation capability is most appropriate

## QUESTION 392  

The electrophysiologic study tracing in Fig. 3.20 was obtained from a 28- year- old man with palpitations, recurrent syncope, and a structurally normal heart. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy?  

A. Atenolol  
B. Verapamil  
C. Pacemaker implantation  
D. Radiofrequency catheter ablation  
E. Defibrillator implantation 

## QUESTION 393  

Which of the following statements about the antiarrhythmic drug dofetilide is NOT correct?  

A. It has significant renal excretion  
B. It prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent fashion

## QUESTION 394  

A 26- year- old construction worker comes to the emergency department on the morning of January 2 in atrial fibrillation. He states that for the past few months he has had occasional episodes of palpitations, almost always on Mondays. His vital signs include heart rate of 140 beats/minute, respirations of 16 breaths/minute, and blood pressure of \(160 / 95\mathrm{mmHg}\) . His physical examination is unremarkable. While being observed in the hospital, he spontaneously reverts to normal sinus rhythm. The most likely precipitating cause is:  

A. Caffeine 
B. Cocaine 
C. Alcohol 
D. Hypertension 
E. Mitral valve prolapse
