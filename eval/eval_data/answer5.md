## ANSWER TO QUESTION 630  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 32: p. 580; Fig. 32.1)  

In the United States, standard screening of young athletes typically consists only of history- taking and physical examination. This approach has a limited capability for detecting serious forms of cardiac disease that could lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) during training, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), anomalous origin of the coronary arteries (AOCA), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and inherited arrhythmia syndromes (e.g., long QT syndromes or Brugada syndrome). Patients with a family history of SCD or premature heart disease, as well as those with cardiac symptoms (including inordinate exertional dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or near- syncope) or a heart murmur that augments with standing or Valsalva maneuver, warrant a more complete evaluation, usually including electrocardiography and echocardiography. This issue is particularly relevant since implantation of automatic defibrillators can prevent SCD in patients with certain predisposing conditions.  

Although contemporary data indicate that sudden arrhythmic death syndrome in the presence of a structurally normal heart is a more common cause of SCD in young athletes than was previously appreciated, structural heart diseases, including HCM, remain important sources of SCD in this population. HCM can be difficult to distinguish from the physiologic hypertrophy observed in individuals who participate in chronic endurance or isometric activities ("athlete's heart"), in whom left ventricular (LV) wall thicknesses of 13 to 15 mm can be observed (Fig. 5.2). Thus, voltage criteria for LV hypertrophy do not establish the diagnosis of hypertrophic or hypertensive cardiomyopathy in trained athletes. Echocardiographic findings more suggestive of pathologic hypertrophy include (1) LV wall thicknesses greater than 15 mm, (2) prominent asymmetric LV hypertrophy, (3) LV end- diastolic cavity diameter less than 45 mm, (4) marked left atrial enlargement, (5) abnormal LV Doppler filling patterns, and (6) lack of regression of hypertrophy after a period of deconditioning. A distinguishing feature during cardiopulmonary exercise testing is that conditioned athletes with physiologic hypertrophy can achieve maximum oxygen uptakes greater than 45 mL/kg/min (>110% predicted), whereas those with HCM typically cannot. Patients in whom cardiac assessment reveals HCM should be restricted from competitive athletics.

AOCA is another type of structural abnormality associated with SCD risk in young athletes but is a less common cause of SCD than HCM in the United States. Evaluation for this diagnosis includes coronary angiography or computed tomography angiography.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 631  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 94: p. 1757)  

Thromboembolism is common in hospitalized patients with COVID- 19 infection. Although estimates vary across epidemiological studies of COVID- 19 patients, approximately \(2\%\) to \(5\%\) of non- critically ill hospitalized patients and \(20\%\) to \(40\%\) of critically ill patients (i.e., those admitted to intensive care units) develop thrombotic complications. The risk of thromboembolism in nonhospitalized patients with COVID- 19 is much lower.  

Venous thromboembolism (e.g., pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis) occurs more frequently in COVID- 19 than do arterial thrombotic events (e.g., ischemic stroke, type I myocardial infarction). Levels of D- dimer are often elevated in COVID- 19 infection, and higher levels are associated with a greater risk of thrombotic complications and worse prognosis. Guideline threshold values of D- dimer used to exclude venous thromboembolism in the general population also apply to patients with COVID- 19.  

Although there were multiple reports of myocarditis in the early phase of the COVID- 19 pandemic, subsequent studies have concluded that the incidence of myocarditis in patients with SARS- CoV- 2 infection is very low. Thus, most thromboembolic events are not associated with concurrent myocarditis.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 97: p. 1812; Table 97.3)  

This patient has signs and symptoms of Takayasu arteritis (TA), an idiopathic large- vessel vasculitis that usually affects the aorta and its branches. TA is 10 times more likely to affect women than men, and the median age of onset is 25 years. This disease occurs worldwide, with a prevalence of 2.6 per million in the United States and 1.26 per million in northern Europe. Features that should prompt consideration of TA are listed in Table 5.1.  

## TABLE 5.1 "Red Flags" for Takayasu Arteritis  

In patients younger than 40 years, the following may be indicative of TA: Unexplained acute- phase response (raised ESR and/or CRP) Carotidynia Hypertension Discrepant blood pressure between the arms \((>10\mathrm{mmHg})\) Absent/weak peripheral pulse or pulses Limb claudication Arterial bruit Angina  

CRP, C- reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; TA, Takayasu arteritis.  

Clinically, arterial stenoses in TA occur three to four times more often than aneurysms. Thus, claudication (more common in the upper than lower extremities) is the major symptom. On physical examination, bruits and asymmetric pulses are the most frequent findings. When aneurysms occur, the aortic root is the most common location, which can lead to aortic regurgitation. Hypertension is common and is often caused by renal artery stenosis. Coronary arterial vasculitis most often affects the ostia of the vessels, leading to myocardial ischemia. In addition, myocardial dysfunction may occur in up to \(20\%\) of patients.  

Treatment involves high- dose corticosteroids in combination with a glucocorticoid- sparing agent, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, leflunomide, or intravenous cyclophosphamide. In patients with progressive disease despite initial therapy, anti- tumor necrosis factor therapy (e.g., infliximab) and anti- interleukin- 6 therapy (i.e., tocilizumab) may be added. Anatomic bypass of clinically significant stenoses may be necessary. Involvement of the aortic root may necessitate aortic root repair, with or without valve replacement.

This patient has characteristic features of giant cell arteritis (GCA), which may include new- onset headache, scalp and temporal artery tenderness, polymyalgia rheumatica, acute visual abnormalities, and/or claudication of the jaw (Table 5.2). Such symptoms, in the presence of an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in a person older than 50 years, support the diagnosis of GCA and mandate immediate treatment, even without proof of

diagnosis from a temporal artery biopsy. Corticosteroid treatment is the most effective therapy for GCA, and dramatic clinical improvement typically follows within 24 to 72 hours. The ESR itself does not always normalize with effective therapy, and it should not be relied upon as the primary indicator of ongoing disease activity.  

Most cytotoxic and other immunosuppressive agents, including anti- tumor necrosis factor agents, have not proved effective in GCA in randomized controlled studies. However, a trial of tocilizumab (anti- interleukin- 6 agent) used in combination with corticosteroids resulted in a higher rate of sustained remission from GCA at 1 year compared with corticosteroids alone.2

Hypertension during pregnancy is associated with increased maternal mortality and morbidity and may present in distinct forms (Table 5.3): (1) gestational hypertension (hypertension that develops after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive patient), (2) preeclampsia (gestational hypertension with proteinuria or new- onset maternal end organ damage), (3) chronic hypertension (hypertension diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation or that does not resolve in the postpartum period), and (4) chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is more likely to occur in primigravid patients, in twin pregnancies, and in those with preexisting hypertension. Preeclampsia is an emergency and requires hospitalization for close maternal- fetal monitoring, control of hypertension, intravenous magnesium

sulfate to prevent seizures, and consideration of urgent delivery of the fetus, especially after 37 weeks' gestation, after which blood pressure usually normalizes rapidly. Eclampsia is present when findings of preeclampsia are accompanied by neurologic complications, including seizures.  

Pharmacologic therapies that have been used successfully to lower blood pressure during pregnancy include methyldopa, beta blockers (particularly labetalol), calcium channel blockers, and hydralazine. Although these medications are effective in treating chronic hypertension that has worsened during pregnancy, they are not effective in preventing preeclampsia.  

Angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers increase the risk of congenital malformations and neonatal renal failure and should not be used in pregnancy.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 635  

## D (Braunwald, Ch. 91: p. 1710)  

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of mortality for women in the United States, accounting for one in four deaths. Coronary heart disease first presents approximately 10 years later in women than in men, most commonly after menopause. The INTERHEART study demonstrated that this pattern is widely consistent across the world. The age difference may be contributed to by a protective effect of circulating estrogen before menopause, which is supported by the fact that premature menopause is associated with a higher risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, pharmacologic replacement of estrogen after menopause does not prevent clinical cardiovascular events.  

Dyslipidemia, hypertension, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle are all important modifiable risk factors for the development of heart disease in women. Notably, diabetes mellitus confers greater risk for coronary heart disease in women than men, increasing a woman's risk of coronary heart disease by three- to seven- fold, compared with only a two- to three- fold increase in men.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs de novo in the context of pregnancy. It is most commonly diagnosed in the 4 months

<--- Page Split --->

after delivery. When identified during pregnancy, it is usually in the final month of gestation. Although traditionally viewed as an entity distinct from other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, accumulating evidence suggests significant overlap in the genetic predisposition to PPCM and other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy.  

The incidence of PPCM varies by geographic region but is estimated to be between one in 1000 and one in 3200 live births. Risk factors for its occurrence include multiparity, African American race, older maternal age, and preeclampsia.  

Approximately \(50\%\) of patients with PPCM show complete or near- complete left ventricular recovery on standard medical therapy. The other \(50\%\) demonstrate either continued deterioration or persistent left ventricular dysfunction and chronic heart failure symptomatology. Subsequent pregnancies in patients with PPCM with persistent cardiac dysfunction should be discouraged because of the high likelihood of relapse. Even patients who have recovered from an episode of PPCM have a \(30\%\) risk of experiencing relapse during subsequent pregnancies.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 40: p. 772.e1)  

The frequency of perioperative complications in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) has increased because of the greater percentage of high- risk patients who undergo the operation. However, the in- hospital mortality after isolated CABG has declined, from around \(3\%\) in 1997 to 1999 to around \(2\%\) in 2015. The reported incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction varies widely, with a median of \(2.9\%\) .  

Cerebrovascular complications can occur after cardiac surgery by mechanisms that include atherosclerotic cerebral emboli from the aorta, emboli related to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine, and intraoperative hypotension. Prospective studies reveal a post- cardiac surgical incidence of stroke ranging from \(1.5\%\) to \(5.0\%\) . Short- term cognitive decline has been identified in greater than \(50\%\) of patients at the time of hospital discharge.  

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most frequent complications of bypass surgery, developing in up to \(40\%\) of patients within 3 days after surgery. It is associated with a two- to three- fold higher risk of postoperative stroke. Up to \(80\%\) of patients spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm within 24 hours without treatment other than rate control agents. Prophylactic use of beta blockers or amiodarone reduces the occurrence of postoperative AF.  

The incidence of renal failure requiring dialysis after CABG is low \(0.5\% - 1.0\%\) but is associated with greater morbidity and mortality when it occurs. Predictors of postoperative renal dysfunction include advanced age, diabetes, preexisting renal dysfunction, and heart failure. In a randomized trial, N- acetylcysteine did not prevent renal dysfunction after CABG.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 638  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 40: p. 770)  

A variety of conduit options are available for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Saphenous vein grafts are relatively easy to harvest, but they have several drawbacks. Approximately \(8\%\) to \(12\%\) of saphenous vein grafts become occluded during the early perioperative period. By 1 year, \(15\%\) to \(30\%\) of vein grafts have become occluded. Some of these occlusions may be due to endothelial denuding during surgical preparation, thereby predisposing the graft to early thrombosis. Intimal hyperplasia and accelerated atherosclerosis in venous grafts are common, and by 10 years after surgery, the patency rate of saphenous vein conduits is less than \(50\%\) .  

In contrast, internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts, although more difficult to harvest, do not develop intimal hyperplasia and have 10- year patency rates of greater than \(80\%\) . Several potential explanations for the superiority of IMA grafts have been suggested: (1) the medial layer of arterial grafts may derive additional nourishment from the vasa vasorum, (2) the endothelium of the IMA produces high levels of endogenous vasodilators, and (3) the diameter of the IMA is closer to that of the recipient coronary artery than is the diameter of the saphenous vein. Compared with patients with saphenous vein grafts, patients who receive IMA conduits have a decreased risk of death, myocardial infarction, and reoperation. Other arterial conduits, such as the radial artery, are used less often. Although more likely to develop vasospasm than IMA grafts, radial artery grafts are also effective conduits with high long- term patency rates.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 639  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 32: p. 581; see also Answer to Question 630)  

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is a rare, tragic event. Exercise- related SCD has historically been attributed to inherited structural abnormalities, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and anomalous origin of the coronary arteries (AOCA). However, contemporary data suggest that up to \(40\%\) of SCDs in young athletes

<--- Page Split --->

occur without apparent structural abnormality, presumably related to an arrhythmia.  

The optimal cardiovascular screening strategy in young athletes continues to be debated. Because it is common for SCD victims with HCM to have been asymptomatic throughout their lives, routine history and physical examination before undertaking competitive sports will miss many cases.  

The most frequent form of AOCA is anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the right coronary cusp. The opposite configuration, anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left aortic sinus, has also been identified as a cause of SCD. Myocardial ischemia in individuals with anomalous coronaries may relate to a kinked takeoff of the artery or compression of the vessel between the aorta and pulmonary trunk during exercise. Like HCM, coronary anomalies are very difficult to identify by routine screening.  

Much less common causes of SCD in young athletes include myocarditis, aortic dissection, congenital valvular aortic stenosis, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

Although older retrospective data suggested that women experiencing an acute coronary syndrome were less likely to experience chest discomfort than men, contemporary data indicate that symptoms experienced by men and women are more similar than different. Importantly, the large majority of both women and men with acute myocardial infarctions report chest pain. Women presenting with myocardial infarctions tend to be older and typically have more comorbidities (e.g., hypertension) than men. They also often present later in the course of symptoms and more frequently with high- risk clinical findings such as heart failure.  

Women are hospitalized more frequently than men each year for the evaluation of chest pain, but women who present with acute coronary syndromes are twice as likely to have "normal" angiograms, or myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary artery (MINOCA) disease compared with men. Coronary causes of MINOCA include coronary vasospasm, coronary microvascular dysfunction, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection.

The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Each of these agents is in part cleared through renal excretion, and the doses of all four agents must be lowered in patients with reduced creatinine clearance (CrCl). Additionally, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran should not be prescribed at all for patients with CrCl less than \(15\mathrm{mL / min}\) .  

Apixaban has the lowest proportion of renal excretion \((25\%)\) among the available DOACs. Its FDA- approved labeling recommends reduced dosage \((2.5\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily, instead of \(5\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily) for patients with AF and serum creatinine greater than \(1.5\mathrm{mg / dL}\) , if the patient also weighs \(60\mathrm{kg}\) (or less), or if age is 80 years or over. Apixaban is also approved for use in hemodialysis \((5\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily, or \(2.5\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily for age \(\geq 80\) years or body weight \(\leq 60\mathrm{kg}\) ) based on a small pharmacokinetic study. In a retrospective observational cohort study comparing apixaban with warfarin in patients with end- stage kidney disease and AF on dialysis, apixaban was associated with a similar risk of stroke/systemic embolism and a lower risk of major bleeding. Nonetheless, for patients with end- stage renal disease and for those on dialysis there is a long track record of acceptable safety with warfarin, which currently remains the anticoagulant of choice in these conditions.

Past observational studies had suggested a benefit of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy in primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease events. However, subsequent large randomized controlled trials demonstrated that hormone replacement therapy does not reduce coronary events. In the Women's Health Initiative estrogen-only trial, 10,739 postmenopausal women were randomized to placebo or \(0.625\mathrm{mg}\) of oral conjugated equine estrogens daily. The trial was stopped early because there was no significant benefit of estrogen on the primary composite endpoint of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, but the risk of stroke and pulmonary embolism was increased in the estrogen arm of the study.

Factors that significantly increase mortality with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) include older age, female sex, emergency surgery, prior CABG, elevated serum creatinine, left ventricular dysfunction, peripheral arterial disease, severe neurologic disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease. Scoring systems including the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk estimator and the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) can be used to assess the risk of adverse outcomes in individual patients.1,2 Obesity has not been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality or cerebrovascular accidents after CABG; however, it does predict risk of developing postoperative mediastinitis. Although not included in the EuroSCORE, preoperative atrial fibrillation is also associated with increased perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.3

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 644  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 92: p. 1733)  

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is rare in women of childbearing age, but pregnancy increases the risk three- to fourfold. The majority of AMIs occur in the third trimester or postpartum period, and two- thirds of AMIs are anterior in location. Although atherosclerotic disease is uncommon in young women, there is a relatively high incidence of traditional risk factors among those who experience AMI during pregnancy, including cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. The most common findings at coronary angiography in pregnant women with AMI are atherosclerotic disease (with or without intracoronary thrombus) or spontaneous coronary artery dissection, the latter being the most common cause of AMI in the peripartum period. Coronary spasm or embolism is much rarer. Even during pregnancy, acute management of ST- segment elevation AMI warrants urgent coronary angiography, with percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting if appropriate.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 645  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 37: Table 37.1)  

Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) has a major adverse effect on early and late prognosis following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The reported incidence of this complication is variable (0% to \(>10\%\) ) because of heterogeneous diagnostic criteria, with a median of \(2.9\%\) . The diagnosis of MI immediately after CABG can be difficult, because usual criteria are not often applicable. For example, symptoms are not reliable, because most patients are sedated and may not sense ischemic pain. Conversely, any chest discomfort described by the patient may be difficult to distinguish from sternal or pericardial sensations. The electrocardiogram may not be diagnostic, because ST- segment abnormalities are very common after CABG. If new ST- segment elevations are observed, however, there should be concern for acute graft failure or spasm, which must be differentiated from the common diffuse ST- segment elevations representative of postoperative pericardial inflammation. The most reliable electrocardiographic findings of a post- CABG MI are new and persistent Q waves. Echocardiography may aid in the diagnosis of postoperative MI, as new wall motion abnormalities support the diagnosis of myocardial injury. However, abnormal septal motion is not specific, because most patients who undergo cardiac surgery have paradoxical septal movement for at least several months after cardiac surgery. Serum markers of myocardial necrosis are also difficult to interpret in the post- CABG setting. Total creatine kinase elevations are almost universally observed because of damage to skeletal muscle in the chest wall. Myocardial- specific creatine kinase- MB isoenzymes and cardiac troponin are frequently detected in the serum as a result of myocardial incisions made for cardiopulmonary bypass. As a result, the fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction defines MI after CABG as an elevation of cardiac biomarker values to more than 10 times the 99th percentile upper reference limit (in patients with normal baseline troponin values) in the presence of other clinical findings supportive of myocardial infarction, including (1) new pathological Q waves, (2) angiographic evidence of new coronary or bypass graft occlusion, and/or (3) imaging evidence of a newly infarcted myocardial territory.  

Clinical risk factors for peri- CABG MI include older age, longer pump time, elevated left ventricular end- diastolic pressure, preoperative unstable angina, and significant left main coronary artery disease.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 90: p. 1696)  

Older patients who present with acute myocardial infarction (MI) are more likely to have medical comorbidities and to develop complications of MI, including heart failure, mechanical complications (e.g., ventricular septal rupture), and death compared with younger patients. Timely coronary reperfusion (with percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or fibrinolysis) leads to improved survival

<--- Page Split --->

in older patients with ST- segment elevation MI. However, because older patients have a higher risk of major bleeding (including intracranial hemorrhage) with fibrinolysis than do younger patients, primary PCI is preferred in this population. Similarly, in patients over 75 years old who undergo PCI, antiplatelet therapy with prasugrel increases the risk of fatal bleeding events compared with clopidogrel and should be avoided in this population.  

Ventricular remodeling after infarction may differ in the elderly because of alterations in the inflammatory response, decreased ability of the myocardium to hypertrophy, and increased collagen content of cardiac tissue. However, elderly patients benefit as much as younger individuals from beta blocker therapy for secondary prevention. In addition, in patients older than 65 years of age who have sustained an MI with residual left ventricular ejection fraction less than \(40\%\) , angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors reduce fatal and nonfatal events just as they do for younger individuals.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 647  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 23:pp.415-416)  

Many patients over 40 years of age are likely to have coronary artery disease or other cardiac conditions that may influence the safety of noncardiac surgery. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is one tool used to estimate the risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications. The RCRI includes the following six independent predictors of increased risk: high- risk type of surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, history of congestive heart failure (e.g., the \(\mathrm{S}_3\) gallop described in the vignette), history of cerebrovascular disease, preoperative treatment with insulin, and a preoperative serum creatinine greater than \(2\mathrm{mg / dL}\) . The more variables present, the greater the risk of a perioperative cardiovascular complication.  

Notably, statistically nonsignificant risk factors include smoking, hyperlipidemia, and mild to moderate hypertension. And while preoperative unstable symptoms of angina portend a complicated postoperative course, such is not the case for patients with stable class I to II angina or remote myocardial infarction without active angina. A history of supraventricular arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation should alert the clinician to the possible development of similar rhythm disturbances postoperatively. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia has not been associated with poor postoperative outcomes.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 90: p. 1704)  

Multiple randomized placebo- controlled trials have demonstrated that treatment of hypertension reduces cardiovascular risk in elderly patients. In the landmark Hypertension in the Very Elderly trial, treatment of systolic hypertension to a target blood pressure of less than \(150 / 80\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) in patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) of \(160\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) or more reduced the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and all- cause mortality. In the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, there was a significant reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality in adults with SBP greater than 130 mm Hg (including those aged \(\geq 75\) years) who were randomized to a target SBP of \(120\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) compared with a target of \(140\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) . As a result, the 2017 Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults recommends a blood pressure less than \(130 / 80\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) for all adults, with the caveat that clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team- based approach should be applied to assess risks and benefits for adults 65 years and over.  

First- line antihypertensive therapies in the elderly include thiazide diuretics, angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In the absence of a specific indication (e.g., heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or postmyocardial infarction), beta blockers are not first- line agents, as they appear to offer less protection against stroke than do other antihypertensives.  

Data from the Framingham Study have confirmed the importance of left ventricular hypertrophy as an independent risk factor for adverse cardiac outcomes in older, hypertensive subjects. Hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the elderly tends to be more common in women, and the presenting symptom is usually dyspnea.

D (Braunwald, Ch 92: pp. 1723- 1724; Table 92.1)Several hemodynamic alterations occur during normal pregnancy (Fig. 5.3). Blood volume increases substantially, beginning during the second month and rising to an average volume expansion of \(50\%\) by late pregnancy. The increase in blood volume outpaces an increase in hemoglobin, so anemia is common. The greater blood volume augments ventricular preload and stroke volume. The heart rate also rises steadily, usually by 10 to 20 beats/minute by the third trimester. The augmented heart rate and stroke volume lead to a rise in cardiac output throughout pregnancy. Systemic vascular resistance begins to fall during the first trimester, reaches its nadir in midpregnancy, then

returns to prepregnancy levels before delivery. The drop in systemic vascular resistance likely reflects a combination of circulating gestational hormones, vasodilating prostaglandins, atrial natriuretic peptides, and nitric oxide, as well as the low- resistance circulation of the gravid uterus.

Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets a subdomain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), also known as ErbB2. It is predominantly used to treat HER2- positive metastatic breast cancer and may also be effective in nonsmall cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer. The main potential cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab is cardiomyopathy, which may lead to severe clinical heart failure (HF). The risk of cardiomyopathy and HF is greatest in the setting of prior or concomitant anthracycline exposure. In many cases, the cardiomyopathy is partially or completely reversible with avoidance of trastuzumab and initiation of neurohormonal blockade.  

Bevacizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway and has activity against a broad range of solid tumors. VEGF inhibitors may cause substantial systemic arterial hypertension through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Less common cardiovascular complications of VEGF inhibitors include heart failure and arterial thromboembolic events.  

Ipilimumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets cytotoxic T- lymphocyte- associated antigen 4 (CTLA- 4). Checkpoint proteins like CTLA- 4 are important negative regulators of T- cell activation, and inhibiting their function results in antineoplastic activity by activating the immune system. Because checkpoint inhibitors do not selectively enhance the antitumor immune response, they can also cause widespread adverse inflammatory reactions. Although the risk is low, these agents have been associated with clinically significant, and in some cases lethal, myocarditis.  

Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of androgens to estrogen and is a highly effective therapy in the treatment of hormone receptor- positive breast cancer. In contrast to the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors are not associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. They are, however, associated with increased total cholesterol and hypertension.

This patient presents with an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and a markedly abnormal electrocardiogram. Electrocardiographic abnormalities are present in approximately \(70\%\) of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and can include ST- segment elevation or depression, deep symmetric T wave inversions (as seen in this patient), and a prolonged QT interval that can lead to torsades de pointes. The mechanism of cardiac and electrocardiographic abnormalities in acute brain injury likely relates to autonomic nervous system dysfunction and excessive myocardial catecholamine release. In this setting, myocardial damage can occur with release of cardiac biomarkers, without primary acute coronary plaque rupture or thrombus formation. Higher peak troponin values, but not the magnitude of electrocardiographic abnormality, are predictive of worse outcomes. Beta blockers appear to be helpful in minimizing myocardial damage and controlling arrhythmias in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

It is generally safe and appropriate to continue most chronically administered cardiac medications up to the day of surgery and to resume them as soon as possible after the operation. This is true of beta blockers in patients with underlying coronary artery disease (or other indications for chronic beta blocker use), and continuing such therapy perioperatively is a class I American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association guideline recommendation. However, there has been controversy about the role of initiating preoperative beta blocker therapy for the purpose of risk reduction. Conclusions from randomized clinical trials have varied, in part related to methodologic differences in the studies. The evidence to date suggests that beta blockers reduce the perioperative risk of cardiovascular events (ischemia, atrial fibrillation, need for coronary interventions) but can be associated with bradycardia,

<--- Page Split --->

hypotension, and stroke, particularly if high doses or long- acting preparations are initiated shortly before surgery. If initiation of preoperative beta blocker therapy is planned, it should be started at least 2 to 7 days before surgery to assess tolerability and safety and to allow titration of the dosage if appropriate. Thus, current guidelines recommend against initiation of a beta blocker without dose titration immediately before surgery (especially high- dose or long- acting forms).  

Although nitrates reduce intraoperative ischemia, cardiac outcomes are not affected.  

Statins have antiinflammatory and plaque- stabilizing properties, and studies in patients undergoing vascular surgery have demonstrated lower cardiac event rates in patients on statin therapy perioperatively.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 653  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 90: p. 1687)  

Assessment of the heart's normal aging process is difficult because of the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in older individuals. Studies in which coronary artery disease and other common cardiovascular conditions have been carefully excluded have revealed several pertinent findings. First, there is moderate hypertrophy of left ventricular myocardial cells, probably in response to increased arterial stiffness and loss of cardiac myocyte number with age. Although myocardial cells are unable to proliferate, they can increase in size as an adaptive response. Despite alterations in contractile proteins leading to reductions in the velocity of contraction and lengthening of contraction and relaxation times, peak contractile force production is maintained at normal levels, and there appear to be no changes in cardiac output, stroke volume, or ejection fraction at rest with normal aging. However, there are changes in beta- adrenoceptor- mediated inotropic and chronotropic cardiovascular responses with aging that result from generalized desensitization. Thus, the maximal heart rate during exercise and other cardiovascular responses to exercises are blunted.  

Among the cellular and molecular changes that occur with aging, endothelial provision of nitric oxide (NO) decreases, likely reflecting a combination of decreased endothelial cell mass (due to cellular senescence and apoptosis) and increased NO utilization because of elevated vascular superoxide anion production in older subjects.

Deep sternal wound infection is among the most serious complications of cardiac surgery. Patients with deep sternal wound infections present approximately 2 weeks after surgery with fever, leukocytosis, bacteremia, discharge, and erythema at the wound site. Risk factors for the development of mediastinal infection include prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, excessive bleeding necessitating reexploration for hemostatic control, the use of bilateral internal mammary arteries, older age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and preoperative atrial fibrillation. Obesity is the most important risk factor for sternal dehiscence, whether or not infection is present.  

Approximately half of deep sternal wound infections are caused by Staphylococcus species, and gram- negative organisms account for approximately \(40\%\) . Confirmation of a sternal wound infection often requires surgical exploration and removal of material for culture. Imaging techniques, including computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, are helpful. Intravenous antibiotics, with possible debridement and irrigation, may be required for prolonged periods. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment improve the prognosis. Mediastinal infections have not been shown to change patency rates of bypass grafts.

Right heart catheterization plays an important role in the evaluation of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) to confirm the diagnosis, to classify PH appropriately, and to guide treatment selection. A major branch point in the classification of PH is the delineation between pre- capillary PH, in which the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is \(15\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) or less, and postcapillary PH, in which the PCWP is greater than \(15\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) . A subset of patients with precapillary PH have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a disorder characterized by plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy in the absence of other conditions that affect pulmonary artery pressure.  

Pulmonary vasoreactivity testing is a diagnostic maneuver that helps guide therapy in patients with PAH. This testing can be accomplished with inhaled nitric oxide, intravenous adenosine, intravenous epoprostenol, or inhaled iloprost. A positive test is defined by a greater than \(10\mathrm{- mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) to an absolute mean PAP lower than \(40\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) , without a decline in cardiac output or a rise in PCWP. Such a response identifies a subgroup of patients with PAH who benefit from oral calcium channel blockers, of which high doses are generally required for effective treatment.  

An increase in PCWP during vasodilator testing would be suggestive of pulmonary veno- occlusive disease or impending left ventricular failure.

Risk factors for contrast- induced acute kidney injury (CI- AKI) include chronic renal insufficiency, diabetic nephropathy, intravascular volume depletion, renal artery stenosis, and concurrent use of agents that alter renal hemodynamics (e.g., angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors). The smallest possible volume of contrast agent should be used in patients with renal insufficiency, because the risk of nephrotoxicity is related to the amount injected.  

The intervention that has been shown to consistently reduce the incidence of this complication in high- risk patients is intravascular volume expansion with isotonic intravenous (IV) fluids before and after the procedure. A randomized trial of IV isotonic sodium bicarbonate in elective coronary procedures showed no difference in postprocedure CI- AKI compared with IV normal saline, such that either could be used for volume expansion. Several other agents have been evaluated for prevention of CI- AKI, including mannitol, calcium channel antagonists, dopamine, and atrial natriuretic peptide; however, none has been shown to reduce the risk of renal complications. Small studies in the past had suggested that oral administration of N- acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, might reduce the risk of CI- AKI; however, subsequent randomized trials did not confirm this benefit.2,3

The major cardiovascular changes that occur in hypothyroidism include a reduction in cardiac contractility, an increase in systemic vascular resistance, and a slowing of the heart rate. The decreased cardiac contractility and relative bradycardia result in a lower cardiac output. Thyroid hormone normally reduces smooth muscle tone, resulting in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. In the relative absence of thyroid hormone, peripheral vascular tone increases and contributes to hypertension, which is common in hypothyroid patients. Thyroid hormone deficiency results in alterations in myocardial depolarization that can prolong the QT interval. Hypothyroidism is also associated with increased vascular permeability. Thus, pericardial effusions are common, developing in approximately one- third of patients, although progression to cardiac tamponade is rare.

Marfan syndrome, caused by mutations in the fibrillin gene (FBN1), is associated with significant morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes. The most life- threatening complication is aortic dissection, to which patients with Marfan syndrome are predisposed because of aortic cystic medial degeneration. Such dissections usually commence just above the coronary ostia and may extend into the entire length of the aorta. Beta blockers limit aortic shear stress and can slow the rate of aortic root dilation. Angiotensin receptor blockers also slow progression of aortic enlargement, presumably through effects on transforming growth factor beta signaling. Randomized trials suggest that either therapy is equally efficacious, and there is some evidence supporting combination therapy.  

The dimension of the proximal aorta can be followed serially by transthoracic echocardiography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Prophylactic aortic root replacement is recommended in patients with Marfan syndrome once the diameter approaches \(5.0 \mathrm{cm}\) , to prevent dissection and progressive aortic regurgitation. Some groups recommend replacement even earlier, when the diameter is in the 4.5- to \(5.0 \mathrm{cm}\) range.  

Aortic dissection is an unfortunate potential complication of pregnancy in patients with Marfan syndrome, occurring most commonly between the third trimester and the first month postpartum. The risk of dissection in this setting is related to the size of the aortic root and appears to be low in patients with root diameters of \(4 \mathrm{cm}\) or less.  

Progressive valvular impairments are also common in patients with Marfan syndrome. The risk of severe aortic regurgitation increases as the diameter of the aortic root enlarges. Mitral valve prolapse, characterized by elongated and redundant leaflets, is detected in \(60\%\) to \(80\%\) of patients with Marfan syndrome by echocardiography. Progression to severe mitral regurgitation occurs in up to \(25\%\) of patients.

This patient has heparin- induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is characterized by a significant decrease in the platelet count, typically arising 5 to 14 days after initial exposure to heparin. It develops when antibodies form against the heparin- platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex. These antibodies bind simultaneously to the heparin- PF4 complex and to platelet Fc receptors, an action that stimulates platelet activation and thrombosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the measurement of anti- heparin/PF4 antibodies. Notably, on subsequent exposure to heparin, HIT can develop rapidly, even with small doses of the drug. Therefore, patients with a history of type II HIT should never receive any form of heparin.  

When HIT develops, heparin should be stopped immediately (Table 5.4). If continued anticoagulation is required, a parenteral direct thrombin inhibitor, such as bivalirudin or argatroban, can be substituted. Fondaparinux, a synthetic pentasaccharide with anti- factor Xa activity, is another anticoagulant that can be used safely in patients with HIT.  

Low- molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are associated with a lower incidence of HIT than is intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH). However, antibodies to UFH crossreact with LMWHs, so once a diagnosis of type II HIT is made, both types of heparin should be avoided.

However, none of these agents is approved for use in patients with mechanical heart valves. Dabigatran was compared to warfarin in the randomized, prospective RE- ALIGN trial of patients with bileaflet mechanical heart valves. The trial was terminated early because dabigatran was associated with increased rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications compared with warfarin.

Metastatic tumors to the heart or pericardium are much more common than are primary cardiac malignancies. Metastases within cardiac structures are present at autopsy in \(1.7\%\) to \(14\%\) of patients with malignant disease, whereas primary cardiac tumors are found in fewer than \(0.1\%\) of individuals postmortem. The most common malignancy that metastasizes to the heart is lung cancer ( \(36\% - 39\%\) of metastases), followed in frequency by breast cancer and hematologic malignancies. Single metastases to the heart are rare, such that the finding of a solitary cardiac tumor is more likely indicative of a benign process.  

Cardiac metastases typically involve the pericardium and myocardium, while the valves and endocardium are only rarely affected. Many cardiac metastases are clinically silent. For example, in malignant melanoma, \(28\%\) to \(56\%\) of patients have metastases to the myocardium or pericardium, yet cardiac symptoms are rare. The most common clinical manifestations of metastatic disease are due to pericardial effusion (i.e., tamponade), tachycardia, conduction blocks, and congestive heart failure.  

A chylous pericardial effusion is characteristic of lymphoma.

This patient presents with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) after probable streptococcal pharyngitis. ARF typically manifests as a subset of five major manifestations (the "Jones criteria"): carditis, polyarthritis, chorea, subcutaneous nodules, and erythema marginatum. In addition, several other symptoms and laboratory findings are usually present in this condition and constitute minor criteria. These include nonspecific arthralgias (especially of large joints), fever, elevated acute- phase reactants (i.e., erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C- reactive protein), and electrocardiographic findings that include prolongation of the PR interval (not the QT interval). The diagnosis of ARF is made in the presence of preceding group A beta- hemolytic streptococcal infection when two major criteria, or one major and two minor criteria are present.  

In 2015, the Jones criteria were revised to recognize that their clinical utility is determined by the background disease prevalence of acute rheumatic fever in a given population (i.e., the pretest probability). As such, different thresholds are required for meeting the major and minor criteria in low- risk versus moderate- and high- risk populations (Table 5.5).

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 663  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 97: p. 1810)  

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common systemic rheumatic disorder. Potential cardiac complications include pericardial, myocardial, coronary, or conduction system disease. The incidence of symptomatic pericarditis has declined ( \(< 2\%\) of patients) with current aggressive management and increasing use of biologic therapies in RA, and asymptomatic pericardial effusions are more common than acute pericarditis. Progression to pericardial constriction is very rare.  

In electrocardiogram screening studies, conduction system abnormalities (e.g., first- degree atrioventricular block) have been identified in up to \(50\%\) of RA patients, but they are rarely symptomatic. In some cases, rheumatoid nodules, rheumatic myocarditis, or cardiac amyloid deposition may contribute to conduction system abnormalities. In addition, the risk of sudden cardiac death is two- fold higher in patients with RA compared with healthy controls.  

Patients with RA have an augmented risk of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, likely related to both traditional risk factors and disease- related inflammation. Women with RA are twice as likely as age- matched controls to suffer a myocardial infarction, a risk on par with patients with diabetes. In the past, coronary arteritis had been reported in up to \(20\%\) of patients in autopsy series; however, this appears to be uncommon in the contemporary era, with widespread use of effective antiinflammatory therapies.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 664  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 66: p. 1276)  

Oral anticoagulation to prevent stroke and other thromboembolic complications is the cornerstone of management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). This patient is at high risk for thromboembolism in the setting of AF because of his age, hypertension, and diabetes status (CHA\(_2\) DS\(_2\)- VASC score \(= 4\) ). He should therefore be treated with anticoagulation.  

Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor that reduces the risk of stroke and systemic embolic events (S/SEE) in patients with nonvalvular AF. In the RE- LY trial, dabigatran (at doses of 110 and 150 mg twice daily) was compared with warfarin (dose adjusted to achieve an international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0) for the prevention of S/SEE in 18,113 patients with nonvalvular AF, followed for a median of 2 years. The annualized rate of S/SEE was 1.7% with warfarin, 1.5% with the lower- dose dabigatran regimen \((P < .001)\) , and 1.1% with the higher- dose regimen \((P < .001)\) . The lower- dose dabigatran regimen was noninferior to warfarin, whereas the higher- dose regimen was actually superior to warfarin for S/SEE prevention. The annualized rates of major bleeding were 3.4% with warfarin compared with 2.7% and 3.1% with the lower- dose and higher- dose dabigatran regimens, respectively. That is, the lower- dose dabigatran regimen resulted in less major bleeding than warfarin, whereas bleeding rates were similar in the higher- dose dabigatran and warfarin arms. Importantly, rates of intracranial hemorrhage were significantly lower in patients randomized to either dose of dabigatran compared with those randomized to warfarin.  

The most common gastrointestinal side effects of dabigatran are dyspepsia and gastritis; hepatotoxicity was not observed with dabigatran in the RE- LY trial.  

The labeling for dabigatran recommends a dose adjustment to 75 mg twice daily for patients with a reduced creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 15 and 30 mL/minute. There is insufficient experience to recommend a dose for a CrCl less than 15 mL/minute.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 665  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 96: pp.1797-1798; Table 96.3)  

Amiodarone, a potent class III antiarrhythmic agent, has two primary effects on thyroid function. First, it inhibits the peripheral conversion of thyroxine \((\mathrm{T_4})\) to triiodothyronine \((\mathrm{T_3})\) , causing a reduction of serum \(\mathrm{T_3}\) and a transient rise in thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH). Within a short time, however, a compensatory increase in serum \(\mathrm{T_4}\) levels occurs, and TSH returns to normal. Clinically, such patients are euthyroid, even though \(\mathrm{T_4}\) levels are elevated. Amiodarone's second thyroid effect relates to its large content of iodine \((30\%)\) by weight), which inhibits synthesis and release of \(\mathrm{T_4}\) from the thyroid gland, causing a more sustained rise in TSH. In some patients, especially those with underlying thyroid disease, clinical hypothyroidism and a marked rise in TSH result.  

Amiodarone- induced hyperthyroidism is less common and may arise from two distinct mechanisms. Type I develops primarily in individuals with underlying thyroid disease, typically in iodine- deficient environments. Such patients display evidence of thyroid autoimmunity, including antithyroid antibodies. In contrast, type II is a form of thyroiditis that develops in a previously normal gland, presumably mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, marked by an elevation of circulating interleukin- 6. This condition is a thyroid- destructive process, and hyperthyroidism results from release of preformed thyroid hormone, a situation that can persist for months. Unlike type I, this form of hyperthyroidism tends to respond to glucocorticoid therapy.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 666  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 89: pp. 1678-1679; see also Answer to Question 486)  

The two principal sleep disorders associated with cardiovascular disease are obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA). OSA is characterized by transient upper airway occlusion that results in partial or complete cessation in airflow leading to hypoxia, sympathetic activation, repeated arousal and wakefulness, and sleep fragmentation. Individuals with OSA demonstrate persistently heightened sympathetic activity, even during daytime wakefulness. This in turn leads to peripheral vasoconstriction and hypertension, as well as automatic tachycardias driven by the augmented sympathetic tone. In addition, reflex parasympathetic activity can lead to profound nocturnal bradycardia.  

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the cornerstone of OSA management. This therapy effectively splints open the airway, thus preventing airway collapse, improving nocturnal hypoxia, and reducing sympathetic activity. Randomized controlled trials of CPAP in OSA have demonstrated decreased daytime sleepiness, improved health- related quality- of- life and mood, and lower blood pressure. While observational trials have suggested decreased mortality with CPAP usage, randomized trials to date have not confirmed that. Importantly, such trials have been limited by either inadequate power or modest CPAP adherence.   

In contrast to OSA, CSA represents an instability of ventilatory control, resulting in oscillations in ventilation with periodic hyperpnea and apnea. When manifest as Cheyne- Stokes respirations, it is associated with advanced heart failure. CPAP is effective in the management of CSA and is associated with decreased sympathetic drive, reduced ventricular afterload, and improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. CPAP has been shown to improve nocturnal oxygen saturation and 6- minute walk distance in patients with class II to IV heart failure and CSA.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 667  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 87: p. 1648; Table 87.7)  

Approximately \(20\%\) of patients with unprovoked deep venous thrombosis experience a recurrence within 2 years of stopping anticoagulation therapy. Therefore, after the initial treatment period of at least 3 months, many experts recommend extended- duration anticoagulation. In a randomized trial of patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation for acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), both standard- dose apixaban (5 mg twice daily) and low- dose apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) were shown to reduce the rate of recurrent VTE compared with placebo without increasing major bleeding. Similarly, extended- duration treatment with rivaroxaban (20 mg daily) in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation for VTE reduced the rate of recurrent VTE compared with placebo in the EINSTEIN DVT Continued Treatment trial. In the EINSTEIN CHOICE trial, extended- duration treatment with either standard- dose rivaroxaban (20 mg daily) or low- dose rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) reduced the rate of recurrent VTE compared with aspirin.  

Extended- duration anticoagulation with both standard- intensity warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] target 2.0 to 3.0) or low- intensity warfarin (INR target 1.5- 2.0) are also valid evidence- based options for extended- duration anticoagulation. However, in contrast to the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), dosing of vitamin K antagonists requires close monitoring and dose adjustment rather than fixed dosing and is associated with higher risk of bleeding. Studies of low- dose aspirin (100 mg daily) versus placebo in patients with unprovoked VTE who have completed at least 6 months of standard anticoagulation have shown a reduction in the rate of recurrence of VTE with aspirin. Thus, although DOACs provide the greatest net clinical benefit for extended- duration anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked

VTE, aspirin offers an evidence- based benefit for patients who refuse, or are unable to tolerate, anticoagulation with DOACs.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 668  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 23: p.410)  

When surgery is elective, it is appropriate to estimate cardiovascular risk using multifactorial indices. Independent predictors of complications with noncardiac surgery include (1) high- risk type of operation, (2) history of ischemic heart disease, (3) history of heart failure, (4) history of stroke, (5) diabetes with preoperative insulin use, and (6) preoperative serum creatinine greater than \(2\mathrm{mg / dL}\) . An example of a high- risk operation is abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, whereas low- risk procedures include endoscopy, cataract surgery, superficial procedures and biopsies, and transurethral prostate surgery. Carotid end- . arterectomy is an example of an intermediate- risk surgery.  

Ischemic heart disease is a major determinant of perioperative morbidity and mortality. However, if a patient is clinically stable and can carry a grocery bag up one flight of stairs (the equivalent of \(>4\) metabolic equivalents of activity) without stopping or experiencing anginal symptoms, most surgical procedures will be well- tolerated, and no additional preoperative cardiac testing is typically necessary. Conversely, a patient who develops shortness of breath or chest discomfort with only minor exertion is at high risk for postoperative cardiac events and warrants additional cardiac testing, especially if more than a minor surgical procedure is planned.  

Older data suggested that the cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) was inversely related to the length of time that had passed since the acute coronary event. Studies from the 1970s concluded that purely elective surgery should therefore be delayed for 6 months after an MI to ensure that cardiovascular risk had returned to baseline. In those studies, the risk of recurrent MI or death was approximately \(30\%\) when patients underwent surgery within 3 months of an MI, but only \(5\%\) when 6 months had elapsed before the operation. Later studies, in the era of careful perioperative monitoring, demonstrated much lower cardiovascular complication rates: approximately \(6\%\) risk of recurrent MI for operations performed within 3 months of an MI and \(2\%\) risk for operations performed within 3 to 6 months. These historic risks are less relevant today in the era of early revascularization and highly effective pharmacologic therapies for secondary prevention after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Current guidelines suggest that the highest risk of elective surgery for such patients is limited to the first 30 days after an ACS while the disrupted coronary plaque and myocardium are healing.

The presentation of this patient is most consistent with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). This disorder is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy that manifests in the last month of pregnancy or in the early postpartum period. The incidence is higher in women greater than 30 years of age, women with twin pregnancies, multiparous women, and African American women. Recent studies have suggested significant overlap in the genetic predisposition to PPCM and other forms of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  

The prognosis of this disorder is favorable compared with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, with approximately \(50\%\) of patients showing marked improvement or complete recovery within 6 months postpartum. The remainder either stabilizes with reduced ventricular systolic function or declines progressively, eventually requiring cardiac transplantation. Predictors of poor outcomes include older age, higher parity, severe left ventricular dilatation, and onset of symptoms later after delivery. There is a high risk of relapse of PPCM in subsequent pregnancies. Although that risk appears to be greatest in women who have persistently impaired ventricular function, even patients who have recovered ventricular function have a \(30\%\) risk of experiencing relapse during a later pregnancy.

D (Braunwald, Ch 101: pp. 1880- 1881; Fig. 101.10)Chronic kidney disease (CKD) identifies a patient population at high risk for cardiovascular events, and more severe renal dysfunction is associated with higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Up to \(40\%\) of all patients with CKD who present to the hospital with chest pain have a cardiac event within 30 days, and patients with end- stage renal disease have the highest mortality after acute myocardial infarction of any large population with chronic disease. Contributors to poor outcomes after acute coronary syndromes in patients with CKD include (1) high prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and heart failure, (2) reduced use of effective therapeutics due to fear of worsening renal dysfunction, (3) therapeutic toxicities, and (4) vascular dysfunction that is exacerbated by renal failure, including a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state. Whereas vascular dysfunction contributes to increased rates of coronary thrombosis, uremia is also
