Sacubitril/valsartan is a first- in- class angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) that combines the effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan with those of the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril. Neprilysin inhibition augments the circulating levels of several vasoactive peptides, including the natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and adrenomedullin, resulting in vasodilatory, natriuretic, antifibrotic, and antihypertrophic effects in patients with heart failure (HF). The incremental benefits of ARNI over angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition were studied in the PARADIGM- HF trial, in which 8399 subjects with HF with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] \(\leq 40\%\) ), New York Heart Association (NYHA) II to IV symptoms, and elevated natriuretic peptides were randomized to treatment with sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg twice daily or enalapril 10 mg twice daily after a run- in period designed to ensure tolerability of both drugs at target doses. In this trial, which enrolled predominantly NYHA II and III subjects, treatment with sacubitril/valsartan resulted in a \(20\%\) reduction in the composite outcome of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and a \(16\%\) reduction in overall mortality compared with enalapril. Heart failure guidelines accordingly recommend that, for patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, and with NYHA II to III functional capacity, substitution of an ARNI for ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy should be considered to reduce morbidity and mortality. ARNIs are not currently indicated for patients with acute decompensated HF.  

In the PARAGON- HF trial, 4822 patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF \(\geq 45\%\) ), NYHA class II to III symptomatology, and elevated natriuretic peptide levels were randomized to sacubitril- valsartan or valsartan alone. There was a small, nonsignificant reduction in hospitalizations for HF in the sacubitril- valsartan group and no difference between the cohorts in mortality. On prespecified subgroup analysis there was a suggestion of better outcomes in enrolled patients within the lower range of LVEF \((45\% - 57\%)\) and in women. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved ARNIs for use in patients with chronic HF across the spectrum of ejection fraction. However, this guidance emphasizes that the benefit is greatest in patients with LVEF below normal, and that men with higher ejection fractions are less likely to derive benefit. The European Society of Cardiology 2021 HF guideline similarly embraces ARNI therapy for patients  

with HF and mildly reduced ejection fraction (between \(40\%\) and \(50\%\) ), but does not recommend routine treatment use in those with an ejection fraction closer to the normal range.  

Importantly, like ACE inhibitors, there is a risk of angioedema with sacubitril/valsartan. Thus, ARNIs should not be administered to patients with a history of angioedema or to those who have received an ACE inhibitor dose within the prior 36 hours.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 310  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 48: pp. 938, 940; Fig. 48.6)  

Natriuretic peptides are of importance in the diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in patients with heart failure. The natriuretic peptide system consists of five structurally similar peptide hormones: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), urodilatin (an isoform of ANP), brain- type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C- type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP). ANP is released by atrial myocytes in response to acute increases in atrial pressure. Prohormone BNP is released in response to hemodynamic stress from ventricular dilatation, hypertrophy, or increased wall tension. Prohormone BNP is cleaved by a circulating endoprotease into two polypeptides: the inactive N- terminal proBNP (NT- proBNP), which is 76 amino acids in length, and the biologically active peptide BNP, which is 32 amino acids in length.  

Circulating levels of ANP and BNP are elevated in patients with heart failure. Both ANP and BNP promote vasodilatation and natriuresis, thereby counteracting the salt- and water- retaining effects of the adrenergic, renin- angiotensin- aldosterone, and vasopressin systems. BNP and NT- proBNP levels rise with increasing age and worsening renal function. In contrast, BNP levels have an inverse relationship with body mass index.

<--- Page Split --->

CNP is derived predominantly from endothelial cells in the peripheral vasculature. The precise roles of CNP, urodilatin, and DNP in cardiovascular physiology are unclear.  

A large, multicenter study of patients in the emergency department undergoing evaluation for acute dyspnea showed that a BNP level of greater than \(100~\mathrm{pg / mL}\) is \(90\%\) sensitive and \(76\%\) specific in identifying a cardiac etiology. A BNP level greater than \(400~\mathrm{pg / mL}\) rendered the diagnosis of heart failure likely. Analogous results were found for NT- proBNP- patients in acute heart failure had mean levels greater than \(4000~\mathrm{pg / mL}\) compared with \(130~\mathrm{pg / mL}\) in those without heart failure.  

A substudy of the TACTICS- TIMI 18 trial demonstrated that an elevated BNP level in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes is associated with a higher risk of subsequent congestive heart failure and death.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 311  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 53: p. 1059)  

This patient has heart failure symptoms with a mildly reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, biatrial enlargement, and concentric LV wall thickening. The absence of a physiologic stimulus for left ventricular hypertrophy, the history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and biatrial enlargement suggest an infiltrative cardiomyopathy such as cardiac amyloidosis. The abnormal technetium pyrophosphate scan is consistent with the presence of transthyretin amyloid in the heart. As no mutations are identified on gene sequencing, this likely represents wildtype transthyretin (ATTRwt) cardiac amyloidosis, which could be confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy.  

Based on data from the ATTR- ACT study, this patient would be expected to benefit from treatment with the transthyretin stabilizer tafamadis, which in this trial was associated with reductions in all- cause mortality, fewer hospitalizations, and less functional decline in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Diflunisal is a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug that also stabilizes transthyretin (TTR) and is an alternate treatment in patients with ATTR who do not have significant renal impairment or volume overload. It has been shown to slow progression of neurological impairment in familial amyloid polyneuropathy, and open- label studies in selected patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy have suggested improved survival.  

Patisiran (a small interfering RNA) and inotersen (an antisense oligonucleotide) are parenteral TTR silencers that inhibit hepatic production of TTR protein. They have shown clinical benefit in familial amyloid polyneuropathy and may be effective in reducing progression of cardiac disease in amyloid cardiomyopathy resulting from mutant TTR. However, there are only limited data regarding such treatment in patients with ATTRwt, and use in this condition remains investigational.  

Mavacamten is a novel myosin modulator developed for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that would not be appropriate for this patient with amyloid heart disease.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 312  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 101: p. 1882; Fig. 101.13)  

The cardlorenal syndrome is characterized by worsening renal function during a heart failure hospitalization, or soon after discharge, despite symptomatic improvement with diuretic therapy and maintenance of adequate intra- vascular volume. Underlying chronic kidney disease (e.g., associated with diabetes or hypertension) increases the risk of cardlorenal syndrome, as does neurohormonal activation resulting from impaired cardiac output (CO) and excessive loop diuretic therapy.  

Renal function is an important prognostic indicator in patients with acute heart failure syndromes. Impaired baseline renal function and worsening renal function, during hospitalization or early after discharge, are potent predictors of adverse outcomes, including early readmission rates and mortality. Elevated, not reduced, systemic venous pressure appears to be an important contributing factor to the development of cardlorenal syndrome, because venous congestion contributes to elevated intra- abdominal pressure that can impair glomerular filtration.  

An increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) out of proportion to serum creatinine is a sign of renal hypoperfusion, resulting from low forward CO or intravascular volume depletion because of high doses of intravenous diuretics. The neurohormonal activation accompanying renal hypoperfusion increases proximal sodium and urea reabsorption, while creatinine handling is unaffected, leading to an elevated BUN/creatinine ratio.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 50: pp. 989-990; Table 50.8, Figs. 50.11 and 50.16)  

The effectiveness of digoxin was studied in the Digitalis Investigators Group trial, which enrolled 6800 patients with class I to III heart failure, with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of \(28\%\) . Over 37 months of follow- up, there was a significant decrease in heart failure hospitalizations but no significant improvement in total mortality with digoxin therapy compared with placebo.  

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been a cornerstone of therapy for patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction because of their favorable hemodynamic effects and benefit to

long- term mortality. The Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial II (V- HEFT II) compared the ACE inhibitor enalapril with the combination of hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate in the treatment of chronic moderate congestive heart failure. Survival in the enalapril- treated group proved to be superior.2  

Aggregate clinical data indicate that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are as effective as ACE inhibitors in reducing heart failure- related morbidity and mortality. Candesartan significantly reduced the primary composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure among ACE inhibitor- intolerant patients enrolled in the CHARM- Alternative Trial.3 The VALIANT trial randomized patients with LV dysfunction after myocardial infarction to valsartan, captopril, or both and found similar benefit with the ACE inhibitor or ARB in reducing mortality.4 Thus, ARBs are currently accepted as appropriate substitutes for patients with LV dysfunction who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Of note, and as reviewed in a subsequent question in this section, an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril / valsartan) is now recommended in place of either an ACE inhibitor or ARB for patients with HFrEF and New York Heart Association class II- III symptoms, when feasible.5  

In the RALES trial, the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone was shown to reduce mortality when added to standard heart failure therapy in patients with class III to IV heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than \(35\%\) .6 In both the DAPA- HF (using dapagliflozin)7 and EMPEROR- Reduced (using empagliflozin)8 trials, addition of a sodium- glucose cotransporter- 2 inhibitor to standard optimal medical therapy for HFrEF was associated with reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations (driven principally by the latter) compared with placebo. These benefits were consistent in patients with and without diabetes and have prompted use of sodium- glucose transporter- 2 inhibition as a pillar of standard therapy for symptomatic HFrEF.9

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 314  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 60: pp. 1132- 1133, 1136, 1137, 1139, 1140; Fig. 60.5)  

Long- term outcomes after transplantation improved dramatically with the introduction of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine as the cornerstone of immunosuppression. The median survival of all cardiac transplant patients is now greater than 10 years, with a median survival of 13 years among those patients who are alive 1 year after transplant. By the first year after transplantation, \(90\%\) of surviving patients report no functional limitations.   

The selection of candidates for transplantation is a complex process that integrates assessment of hemodynamics, comorbidities that might limit posttransplantation survival, and psychosocial factors that may impair compliance. Optimal candidates for heart transplantation are younger patients with advanced heart failure, minimal comorbid illness or end- organ damage, a history of adherence to prescribed medical therapy, and a strong family and social network.  

The transplanted heart is denervated and relies on atypical adaptive mechanisms to meet varying demands for cardiac output (CO). As a result of increased venous return at the onset of exercise, the transplanted heart responds with the intrinsic Frank- Starling mechanism to augment CO. Circulating catecholamine levels rise as exercise ensues, providing a delayed chronotropic response. This mechanism allows near- normal hemodynamic function at rest, as well as the capacity to support at least moderate exercise in a large majority of long- term survivors. Of note, beta blockers may impair the heart rate response and should be used cautiously after heart transplantation.  

Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of allograft rejection, though newer approaches, including gene expression profiling and donor- derived cell- free DNA, are increasingly utilized for rejection surveillance in some centers. Biopsies are typically performed using a transjugular vein approach and are carried out on a routine schedule during the post- transplantation period and over the life of the transplant. High- grade rejection may be signaled by the development of clinical heart failure, atrial arrhythmias, low QRS voltage on the ECG, or echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction; however, definitive diagnosis or identification of early or subtle lower- grade rejection requires histologic examination of the myocardium.  

Allograft rejection and infection are the most common causes of death early after transplant. The risk of infection diminishes with time as the intensity of immunosuppression therapy is reduced. In contrast, the risk of fatal malignancy increases progressively in the years thereafter. The most common fatal early malignancies are post- transplant lymphoproliferative disorders and lung cancer.

Mannitol is an inert osmotic agent that expands the extracellular fluid volume; its use is contraindicated in patients with decompensated heart failure.

<--- Page Split --->

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone and eplerenone) act at the renal distal convoluted tubule and cortical collecting tubule to reduce sodium reabsorption and inhibit \(\mathrm{K}^{+}\) and \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\) excretion. Although they are only weak diuretics, they have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in systolic heart failure. However, aldosterone receptor antagonists may contribute to clinically significant hyperkalemia, particularly when used in combination with angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers.  

Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, torsemide, and butemidine, are inhibitors of the \(\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+} / 2\mathrm{Cl}^{- }\) cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Inhibition of this cotransporter markedly increases the fractional excretion of sodium and chloride. However, the delivery of large amounts of sodium and fluid to the distal nephron increases \(\mathrm{K}^{+}\) and \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\) secretion, leading to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.  

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs) may impair renal function and diminish the action of diuretics by inhibiting the production of vasodilating prostaglandins. All NSAIDs, including aspirin, have this potential effect, which can contribute to diuretic resistance in individuals with an initially favorable diuretic response.

This patient presents after an exacerbation of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. She is on an appropriate regimen of guideline-directed medical therapy that includes sacubitril/valsartan, which was initiated during the hospitalization. This approach is supported by the PIONEER- HF trial in patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure, in which initiation of sacubitril/valsartan led to greater improvement in N- terminal pro- B- type natriuretic peptide levels compared with enalapril therapy. Because she has chronic renal disease, close monitoring of the serum potassium level would be appropriate on the combination of the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone.  

Addition of a sodium- glucose transporter- 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (e.g., dapagliflozin) would be appropriate for most patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. However, SGLT2 inhibitors are not recommended for patients with type 1 diabetes, such as this patient because of the increased risk of ketoacidosis. Digoxin therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction may reduce heart failure hospitalizations, but due to the narrow therapeutic window, this agent has been relegated to use only in patients with heart failure refractory to other standard therapies.  

Vericiguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that has been shown in the VICTORIA trial to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization among high- risk, recently hospitalized patients with symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction of \(45\%\) or less. In the trial, the drug was well tolerated and now carries a class IIb indication by the European Society of Cardiology 2021 heart failure guidelines for patients who experience worsening heart failure symptoms despite treatment with an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (or angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), beta- blocker, and mineralocorticoid antagonist.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 46: pp. 892-893, 900-903; Table 46.2; Figs. 46.4 and 46.13)  

The binding of a beta- adrenergic agonist to its myocyte receptor initiates a complex system of messengers within the sarcolemma and cytosol of the cell. The beta \(_1\) receptor is coupled, via G- proteins, to activation of adenylate cyclase and formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This molecule acts via protein kinases to phosphorylate proteins and enzymes within the cell. Such action stimulates enhanced entry of calcium ions through voltage- dependent L- type calcium channels, followed by additional calcium- induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The rise in cytosolic calcium increases calcium- troponin C interaction, a necessary step for subsequent contraction. The activated troponin C binds tightly to the inhibitory molecule troponin I, thus removing inhibition of actin- myosin cross- bridge formation, and contraction ensues.  

Whereas cAMP is a second messenger for the beta- adrenergic system, another cyclic nucleotide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), acts as a second messenger during cholinergic stimulation. In vascular smooth muscle, cGMP acts as an intracellular messenger after nitric oxide stimulation.  

Titin is a large protein that provides elasticity and supports the myosin molecule by tethering it to the myocyte Z line.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 318  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 60: p. 1137)  

Rejection is a ubiquitous concern after solid organ transplantation. It results from cell- or antibody- mediated allograft injury owing to recognition of the allograft as nonself tissue. Three major types of rejection have been identified: hyperacute, acute, and chronic. Hyperacute

<--- Page Split --->

rejection occurs within minutes to hours after heart transplantation and is mediated by preexisting antibodies to allogeneic antigens on the vascular endothelium that fix complement. This results in occlusion of graft vasculature and overwhelming graft failure. In contrast, the biopsy specimen in this question shows a dense lymphocytic infiltrate and myocyte damage typical of acute cellular allograft rejection. Acute cellular rejection is a T- cell- mediated process that develops in the first weeks to 6 months after transplantation. Chronic rejection, or late graft failure, is an irreversible deterioration of graft function years after transplant mediated by antibodies or progressive graft loss from ischemia.  

Risk factors for rejection include female gender, Black recipient race, recipient- positive cytomegalovirus serology, prior infections, and the number of human leukocyte antigen mismatches. Patients who do not experience acute rejection within the first 6 months after transplantation have a lower incidence of late rejection.  

Although progress has been made in novel noninvasive serologic approaches to identify acute rejection, including gene expression profiling and donor- derived cell- free DNA, endomyocardial biopsy remains the diagnostic gold standard. The procedure is performed under fluoroscopic or echocardiographic guidance using a bioptome inserted percutaneously via the right internal jugular vein. Potential complications include pneumothorax, transient rhythm disturbances, myocardial perforation, and tricuspid regurgitation.  

The most important feature of the post- transplant biopsy specimen is the detection of lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of myocyte necrosis. A revised continuum scale has been established for grading cardiac biopsies from no rejection (grade OR) to diffuse damaging inflammatory cell infiltrates with encroachment of myocytes and disruption of normal cell architecture (grade 3R). Appropriate therapy for acute cellular rejection depends on the timing and severity of the rejection episode. Episodes that occur within the first 3 months, or episodes that are moderate to severe, are initially treated with pulsed- dose methylprednisolone. If steroid therapy is ineffective, then more aggressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin may be necessary.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 319  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 22: p. 393; Table 22.1; Ch 48: pp. 942-943)  

The four primary determinants of cardiac output (CO) are (1) heart rate; (2) preload, which is closely related to left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume; (3) afterload, which is closely related to aortic impedance (i.e., the sum of the external factors that oppose ventricular ejection); and (4) contractility, a fundamental property of cardiac muscle that reflects the level of activation of cross- bridge formation. Preload, afterload, and contractility determine the ventricular stroke volume (SV), and \(\mathrm{CO} = \mathrm{Heart rate} \times \mathrm{SV}\) .   

Unlike other organs, the myocardium extracts oxygen from blood nearly maximally. Thus, even at rest, the oxygen saturation in coronary venous blood (measured at the coronary sinus) is quite low, usually less than \(40\%\) .  

The body's oxygen consumption at peak exercise is an indirect measure of the CO. The peak oxygen uptake \((\mathrm{VO}_2\) max) is defined as the value achieved when \(\mathrm{VO}_2\) plateaus despite a continued increase in the intensity of exercise. The anaerobic threshold is indicated by the \(\mathrm{VO}_2\) at which carbon dioxide production starts to rise, resulting in an increase in the \(\mathrm{VO}_2 / \mathrm{VO}_2\) ratio. Both the peak oxygen consumption and the anaerobic threshold are reproducible when measured days or weeks apart. During exercise, the CO of a normal heart increases up to six- fold, and the body's oxygen consumption can increase up to 18- fold.  

In patients with LV dysfunction, cardiopulmonary exercise tests are often performed to determine functional capacity. A peak oxygen consumption of greater than \(20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{minute}\) reflects mild or no functional impairment. Conversely, a peak oxygen consumption of less than \(12 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{minute}\) indicates severe impairment and a poor prognosis. Serial tests can be performed over time to assess the response to pharmacologic therapies in patients with heart failure and can help guide the need for aggressive interventions such as cardiac transplantation or placement of a ventricular assist device.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 320  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 47: pp. 921-922)  

By the law of Laplace, left ventricular (LV) wall stress \((\sigma)\) is directly proportional to intracavitary pressure and chamber radius and inversely proportional to wall thickness. Ventricular hypertrophy is therefore an adaptive mechanism that serves to reduce ventricular wall stress. Myocardial hypertrophy and remodeling proceed in different patterns based on the timing and nature of the provocative stimulus. When the primary stimulus is pressure overload (as in aortic stenosis or hypertension), an increase in wall stress during ventricular systole triggers the addition of new myofibrils in parallel, leading to wall thickening at the expense of chamber size, in a pattern of concentric hypertrophy. When the primary stimulus is volume overload (as in chronic mitral regurgitation), increased wall stress during ventricular diastole triggers the replication of sarcomeres in series, elongation of myocytes, and ventricular cavity dilatation, in a pattern of eccentric hypertrophy. Therefore, although both chronic pressure and volume overload are associated with a compensatory increase in LV mass, the pattern of hypertrophy is distinct in each case.  

Using echocardiography, concentric hypertrophy can be distinguished from eccentric hypertrophy visually, or on the basis of the ratio between wall thickness and

<--- Page Split --->

the LV internal diameter during diastole (i.e., the relative wall thickness \(= [2 \times \text{posterior wall thickness}] / \text{LV internal}\) dimension). A relative wall thickness less than 0.45 suggests eccentric hypertrophy, whereas a higher ratio is more consistent with concentric hypertrophy.

Amiodarone has been studied extensively in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. It effectively suppresses ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias and appears to be safe for use in this subset of patients. However, convincing evidence of mortality reduction has not been shown. In the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD- HeFT) study of patients with class II to III heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \(35\%\) or less, amiodarone did not improve survival compared with placebo.  

Dronedarone is a derivative of amiodarone that shares its electrophysiologic properties but does not contain iodine and is associated with lower rates of lung and thyroid toxicity. Dronedarone is approved to facilitate maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It should not be prescribed in class III to IV heart failure because its use was associated with increased mortality in such patients in the Antiarrhythmic Trial with Dronedarone in Moderate- to- Severe Heart Failure Evaluating Morbidity Decrease trial.  

The results of several randomized, controlled clinical trials support the benefit of implantable cardio- . verter- defibrillator (ICD) therapy in reducing mortality among patients with LV dysfunction. The Antiarrhyth- . mics Versus Implantable Defibrillators study randomized patients with reduced LVEF and prior resuscitated cardiac arrest, or symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), to therapy with amiodarone or an ICD. ICD therapy was associated with a \(29\%\) reduction in all- cause mortality compared with amiodarone. A concurrent registry of patients with transient or correctable causes of VT or ventricular fibrillation not enrolled in the primary trial revealed that the risk of mortality in these patients remains comparable with those with primary VT or ventricular fibrillation. ICD therapy is therefore recommended as the standard of care for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death or symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with LV dysfunction.  

The data for ICD efficacy in primary prevention of sudden cardiac death are also compelling. The results of the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation II Trial confirm that, in patients with coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, and LVEF of \(30\%\) or less, prophylactic implantation of a defibrillator reduces mortality by \(31\%\) relative to conventional medical therapy. The results of the SCD- HeFT extended the benefits of ICD therapy to patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Thus, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that patients with mild to moderate heart failure and an LVEF of \(35\%\) or less on optimal medical therapy are potential candidates for ICD implantation.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 322  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 58: p. 1107)  

Ventricular dyssynchrony is defined as a QRS duration greater than 120 milliseconds on the ECG regardless of the QRS morphology. Ventricular conduction delay alters the timing of ventricular activation and places an already failing ventricle under further mechanical disadvantage by reducing contractility and ventricular filling and prolonging the duration of mitral regurgitation. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), also termed biventricular pacing, serves to better coordinate left ventricular (LV) contraction, leading to improved ventricular performance and reduced LV filling pressures.  

CRT improves ventricular function without increasing myocardial energy consumption, in contrast to the effects of inotropic agents such as dobutamine. CRT may also reverse LV remodeling over time, reducing LV mass and end-diastolic dimension while increasing the ejection fraction.  

The CARE- HF trial demonstrated that CRT alone, without a defibrillator, reduces mortality in patients with classes III and IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction of \(35\%\) or less, and ventricular dyssynchrony. CRT combined with an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator has been shown to reduce death and hospitalization rates in patients with classes II and III heart failure and LV systolic dysfunction. The benefit of CRT has more recently been extended to patients with less severe (class I- II) heart failure and QRS widening based on the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial—Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy trial.  

Approximately \(25\%\) of patients receiving CRT under current indications are nonresponders. Contributing factors to nonresponse include coronary venous anatomy that precludes optimal LV lead placement, the presence of ventricular scar, or suboptimal atrioventricular or ventriculo- ventricular activation timing. The greatest benefit of CRT appears to accrue to patients with QRS widening greater than 150 milliseconds and left bundle branch block morphology, compared with those with lesser QRS widening or with right bundle branch block or nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay. Accordingly, per current guidelines, cardiac resynchronization therapy is indicated in New York Heart Association II to IV heart failure patients with LVEF of \(35\%\) or less who are in sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block and QRS duration 120 milliseconds or more (a class IIa indication;

QRS \(\geq 150\) milliseconds is a class I indication). Echocardiography can identify mechanical dyssynchrony, but has not proved useful in selecting patients for successful CRT.5

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 323  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 50: pp. 994-999; Figs. 50.13 and 50.15)  

This patient has heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and New York Heart Association II symptomatology on a pharmacologic regimen that includes a beta blocker, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and sodium-glucose transporter- 2 inhibitor. Although she has only mild heart failure symptoms, she is not fully optimized on guideline- directed medical therapy, and further therapeutic adjustment is indicated to reduce morbidity and mortality.1 Notably, her heart rate is 84 beats/minute in sinus rhythm, and the beta blocker dosage is below guideline- recommended targets (i.e., up to 200 mg daily for metoprolol succinate). The appropriate next step is therefore to intensify beta- blockade. A switch from metoprolol succinate to carvedilol is not necessary, as both are evidence- based therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; as well, the marginal blood pressure makes a shift to a maximal carvedilol dose (50 mg BID) risky, due to the alpha- blocking effects of this class. Increasing the metoprolol dose is a better option in this case. If she does not tolerate augmentation of the beta blocker, then consideration of the \(\mathrm{I}_1\) channel inhibitor, ivabradine, would be appropriate for heart rate reduction. In the SHIFT trial, patients with symptomatic heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction of \(35\%\) or less, and heart rate 70 or more beats/minute in sinus rhythm who were receiving standard heart failure therapy (including beta blockers) were randomized to treatment with ivabradine or placebo. Patients assigned to ivabradine experienced an \(18\%\) reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, driven principally by a reduction in the latter.2 This result led to a class II indication for the addition of ivabradine in patients meeting the SHIFT inclusion criteria.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 324  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 48: p. 935; Table 48.2; Ch 84: pp. 1593-1594)  

This 52- year- old man has symptoms and signs of heart failure. There are several possible contributors to his left ventricular (LV) dysfunction based on the clinical history. The history of smoking and hypertension put him at high risk for coronary artery disease, but there is no evidence of angina or prior myocardial infarction by history or ECG. Long- standing, severe, uncontrolled hypertension may ultimately lead to heart failure owing to progressive LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction; however, this patient's hypertension has been well controlled in recent years. The evidence by chest radiograph and physical examination for an enlarged heart with decompensated heart failure is most consistent with a dilated cardiomyopathy. His confessed alcohol use is moderate; however, patients with excessive alcohol intake may underreport their true consumption. Of the choices presented, the best unifying diagnosis is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  

Heavy alcohol consumption is a leading cause of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in the United States for both men and women. In general, alcoholic cardiomyopathy is associated with heavy alcohol consumption, although the precise amount of alcohol that is "safe" for any given individual is variable. Excessive alcohol consumption causes abnormalities of both systolic and diastolic function, as well as progressive LV cavity enlargement. Frequently, individuals with alcoholic cardiomyopathy develop atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias.  

There is no definitive diagnostic test for alcoholic cardiomyopathy. As a result, it is often recommended that patients with dilated cardiomyopathy abstain completely from alcohol consumption. Total cessation in the early stages of the disease frequently leads to resolution of the manifestations of congestive heart. Continued alcohol consumption leads to further myocardial damage and fibrosis, with the development of refractory heart failure. Patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy benefit from treatment with standard medical therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Because nutritional deficiencies are common in alcoholics and may contribute to myocardial dysfunction, vitamin supplementation (in particular thiamine) should be considered.

## E (Braunwald, Ch 51: pp. 1024, 1028; Table 51.7)  

This patient's presentation is most consistent with the syndrome of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). She exhibits many of the typical demographic

<--- Page Split --->

features, including advanced age, a history of hypertension, and elevated body mass index, as well as clinical signs and symptoms of decompensated heart failure.  

In contrast to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, there are only limited data from prospective, randomized clinical trials to guide appropriate management of this large population of patients. Although aggressive management of hypertension in this disorder can be beneficial, no specific therapy has been clearly associated with a survival benefit.  

The Perindopril in Elderly People with Chronic Heart Failure trial randomized a population of patients with heart failure, normal or near- normal ejection fraction, and age greater than 70 years to treatment with the angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril or placebo and failed to demonstrate a benefit in the primary endpoint of all- cause mortality or unplanned heart failure hospitalizations. The Candesartan Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity- Preserved trial randomized patients with chronic heart failure and ejection fraction greater than \(40\%\) to treatment with the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan or placebo. Fewer hospitalizations for heart failure occurred in the candesartan group, but cardiovascular survival was not improved. In the PARAGON- HF trial (described in the Answer to Question 309), treatment with the angiotensin receptor- neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan did not reduce the primary composite outcome of heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular death in patients with HFpEF compared with valsartan alone, though there appeared to be a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations among those in the mildly reduced ejection fraction group (ejection fraction below the median value of \(57\%\) ).  

In the recent EMPEROR- Preserved trial, 5988 patients with chronic heart failure and New York Heart Association class II to IV symptoms with left ventricular ejection fraction greater than \(40\%\) were randomized to the sodium- glucose cotransporter- 2 inhibitor empagliflozin \(10\mathrm{mg}\) daily or placebo, in addition to usual therapy. The patients who received empagliflozin experienced a \(21\%\) reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations compared with placebo. However, the benefit was driven primarily by reduced hospitalizations, as there was no statistically significant reduction in mortality alone.  

The Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function with an Aldosterone Antagonist trial examined the role of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF and found no impact on the composite of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest relative to placebo; there was a statistically significant reduction in heart failure hospitalizations, however, with spironolactone treatment. In addition, post hoc analysis suggested geographic differences in results in that patients from the Americas with HFpEF benefited from spironolactone, but those from the countries of Russia and Georgia did not, possibly reflecting variation in clinical characteristics of the patients or in technical performance of the study. Accordingly, in the absence of other evidence- based therapy, current guidelines suggest consideration of spironolactone for selected patients with HFpEF to decrease hospitalizations.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 326  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 55: pp. 1086, 1086.e1, 1088)  

The clinical presentation of new- onset heart failure in the context of a viral prodrome suggests myocarditis. Although most cases of myocarditis with antecedent viral infection are related to lymphocytic myocarditis, the rapid and fulminant progression of disease with worsening ventricular function, hypotension, ventricular arrhythmias, and hypoperfusion in this case suggest giant cell myocarditis (GCM). In patients with suspected GCM, endomyocardial biopsy is indicated to clarify the pathologic diagnosis.  

Fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis generally carries a favorable prognosis if the patient can be supported through the period of acute illness. Immune suppression has generally not been effective in facilitating myocardial recovery. GCM, by contrast, carries a very poor prognosis, with a mean transplant- free survival of only 5.5 months. Combination immunosuppressive therapy including cyclosporine, azathioprine, and corticosteroids has been demonstrated to prolong the time to transplantation or death once the diagnosis is confirmed. However, due to the rapid progression and poor survival, urgent mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation is the treatment of choice.

This patient has New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage D congestive heart failure. He is not a candidate for cardiac resynchronization therapy, because the QRS complex duration is normal (see Answer to Question 322). Repeated hospitalizations for heart failure, hyponatremia, intolerance to beta- adrenergic blockade, and a markedly reduced peak oxygen uptake of \(10\mathrm{mL / kg / min}\) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ute are all markers of poor prognosis and, taken together,

predict mortality greater than \(50\%\) in the next year. Such a patient should be considered for advanced therapies, including heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support. Given the limitations of donor supply, cardiac transplantation is generally reserved for younger patients with few comorbid conditions. In addition, because of renal insufficiency and the recent diagnosis of cancer, this patient is unlikely to be eligible for transplantation (either heart alone or combined heart- kidney). Furthermore, the typically long waiting time for a donor heart renders transplantation an impractical immediate solution for this patient with a very limited predicted short- term survival.  

Durable mechanical circulatory devices (i.e., ventricular assist devices) can extend survival and enhance the quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure. Mechanical support can be used as a bridge to transplantation and also as permanent destination therapy in patients for whom cardiac transplantation is not feasible. Such devices may also be used as a bridge to recovery in rare cases of an identifiable, potentially reversible cause of cardiac decompensation, such as acute myocarditis, postcardiotomy syndrome, or peripartum cardiomyopathy. Because this patient is ineligible for transplantation, destination therapy would be the most appropriate mechanical support strategy.  

The Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial evaluated patients with NYHA class IV symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction less than \(25\%\) , most of whom were on continuous intravenous inotropes. REMATCH demonstrated the superiority of an early- generation pulsatile left ventricular assist device (LVAD) compared with medical therapy, but by 2 years of follow- up only \(23\%\) of the patients with the assist devices were still alive.  

Since publication of REMATCH, durable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has undergone a dramatic evolution, with advances in technology that have been associated with improvements in clinical outcome. The primary contemporary device is an intrathoracic, magnetically levitated, centrifugal, continuous flow pump (Heartmate 3) that has been engineered with wide flow paths and intrinsic pulsatility. Data from the MOMENTUM 3 trial demonstrated improved clinical outcomes using the HeartMate 3 compared with an axial flow pump (HeartMate II), with lower rates of stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pump thrombosis, all of which have been important limitations of durable MCS. Of importance, patients being considered for destination LVAD therapy must have adequate native right ventricular (RV) function, because postoperative RV failure is associated with high mortality.  

Although mechanical biventricular support is also available as a bridge to transplantation, it is not currently approved as destination therapy. As this patient has adequate right ventricular function by echocardiography, he should be well supported by an isolated LVAD.  

Finally, palliative and hospice level care play important roles in the care of stage D heart failure patients for whom these advanced options are not practical and there are no reasonable prospects for improvement in quality or length of life.

The Wiggers diagram of the cardiac cycle graphically demonstrates the important temporal relationships between the electrical and mechanical events of cardiac contraction and relaxation (Fig. 3.21). Nearly simultaneous events occur in the right and left sides of the heart during the cardiac cycle; here we concentrate on the left- sided events. Filling of the left ventricle begins in early diastole when the left ventricular (LV) pressure falls below left atrial pressure and the mitral valve opens. The subsequent early phase of rapid ventricular filling corresponds to the timing of the third heart sound \((S_3)\) , which may be audible when filling pressures are increased (as in patients with heart failure).  

As the pressures in the left atrium and ventricle equalize, ventricular filling slows. Filling is then augmented at the end of diastole owing to atrial contraction, which generates the \(a\) wave on the left atrial pressure tracing. Temporally, the \(a\) wave occurs just after the P wave on the surface ECG and coincides with the fourth heart sound \((S_4)\) . In atrial fibrillation, organized atrial contraction is absent, and a discrete \(a\) wave is usually not evident.  

With the onset of the QRS complex on the surface ECG, ventricular systole begins, and the LV pressure begins to rise. When LV pressure exceeds that in the left atrium, the mitral valve closes, producing the first heart sound \((S_1)\) . Ventricular pressure continues to rise at constant ventricular volume (isovolumic contraction) until it exceeds aortic pressure. At this point, the aortic valve opens, and rapid ejection begins. After contraction, as the pressure in the left ventricle falls below the aortic pressure, ejection ceases, and the aortic valve closes, generating the second heart sound \((S_2)\) . Isovolumic relaxation then occurs, beginning ventricular diastole again.  

The \(v\) waves on the right and left atrial pressure tracings correspond to venous return to the atria when the tricuspid and mitral valves are closed. The peak of the \(v\) wave is usually inscribed after electrical repolarization of the ventricles, so that it follows the T wave on the ECG.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 329  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 13: p. 134)  

Because the pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous beds, hydrothorax (pleural effusion) may develop when there is marked elevation of pressure in either venous system. Heart failure- related pleural effusions are usually bilateral, but when they are unilateral they are usually present on the right side. When hydrothorax develops, dyspnea becomes more marked because of a further reduction in vital capacity. The absence of pulmonary rales does not exclude considerable elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure, especially in patients with chronic heart failure who may have well- developed lymphatic drainage.  

Hepatomegaly is often present in patients with heart failure before the development of overt peripheral edema. When it develops rapidly with acute congestion, the liver may be tender because of rapid capsular distention.

Peripheral edema often does not correlate well with the degree of systemic venous congestion. Usually, a substantial gain of extracellular fluid volume ( \(>4\) L in adults) must occur before peripheral edema develops.  

With the development of left ventricular failure, pulmonary artery pressures rise, and the pulmonic component of the second heart sound is accentuated. A systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation may also be audible owing to ventricular cavity dilatation.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 330  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 50: p. 1000)  

This patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy due to multives- . sel obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients  

with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure due to CAD may benefit from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), regardless of whether angina is present. Although the original results of the STICH trial did not demonstrate a difference in the primary endpoint of all- cause mortality between medical therapy and surgical revascularization of patients with LV dysfunction and CAD amenable to CABG, secondary outcomes were improved in the revascularization group. In addition, the 10- year follow up of the STICH cohort confirmed the benefits of CABG over medical therapy, with improved median survival observed in subjects allocated to revascularization. Many factors should be considered before referring such a patient for CABG, including the coronary anatomy, the degree of LV dysfunction, the severity of heart failure symptoms, and the magnitude of comorbid medical conditions. Because the benefits of revascularization are thought to result in

<--- Page Split --->

part from improvement in blood flow to previously underperfused but still viable myocardium, testing to assess cellular viability has been utilized to identify patients likely to derive greatest benefit from CABG. In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, the weight of evidence has suggested that significant myocardial viability \((\geq 25\%)\) predicts improvement in survival and quality of life with CABG over medical therapy alone. The myocardial viability substudy of the STICH trial called this conclusion into question, as assessment of viability did not identify patients with a survival benefit with CABG compared with medical therapy alone (i.e., the presence of viable myocardium in patients with CAD and LV dysfunction was associated with greater survival regardless of the treatment approach). Thus, the role of testing for viability is still evolving.  

Segments of markedly hypokinetic or akinetic myocardium identified by resting echocardiography may contain substantially viable myocardium if those areas are simply hibernating or stunned. Myocardial hibernation refers to persistent contractile dysfunction caused by a chronically reduced blood supply, usually a result of multivessel CAD. In such regions, irreversible damage has not occurred, and ventricular function can improve with restoration of adequate blood flow through revascularization. Myocardial stunning refers to reversible postischemic contractile dysfunction that persists for a prolonged period after reperfusion. It is thought to be caused by the generation of oxygen- derived free radicals or the transient loss of contractile filament sensitivity to calcium. This patient's anterior wall akinesis may have resulted from cell death due to prior infarction, or it may represent hibernating myocardium. Viability testing with thallium perfusion imaging, positron emission tomography, or dobutamine echocardiography can confirm whether the anterior wall is viable or permanently scarred.  

Surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) involves the resection of an aneurysmal or akinetic segment after transmural myocardial infarction and reconstruction with a patch. The exclusion of thinned, scarred myocardium restores an elliptical shape to the left ventricle with the goal of diminishing wall stress, mitral regurgitation, and residual ischemia. However, the results of the SVR portion of the STICH trial indicate that routine performance of SVR at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery is not associated with improved clinical outcomes.

## E (Braunwald, Ch 50: p. 1000.e1)  

Disturbances of cardiac rhythm are potentially life- threatening complications of cardiac glycoside administration. Side effects can be minimized by maintaining therapeutic levels of digoxin between 0.5 and \(1.0\mathrm{ng / mL}\) . Although overt digitalis toxicity is usually manifest at serum levels greater than \(2.0\mathrm{ng / mL}\) , adverse drug effects may occur at lower levels, particularly if hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia is present. Digitalis toxicity may be manifest by neurologic symptoms (visual abnormalities, confusion), gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea, vomiting), or ventricular or supraventricular tachycardias and bradyarrhythmias. Common rhythm disturbances include junctional or ventricular ectopic beats, varying grades of atrioventricular (AV) block, accelerated AV junctional rhythm, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block, excessively slow ventricular response to atrial fibrillation, or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. The class IB antiarrhythmic lidocaine may be helpful in managing ventricular arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity, and vagally mediated AV block in this setting often responds to atropine. Conversely, direct- current cardioversion can precipitate serious ventricular arrhythmias in patients with overt digitalis toxicity.   

Owing to its significant binding to plasma proteins and its large volume of distribution, digoxin is not efficiently removed by dialysis. In distinction, in cases of life- threatening overdose, antidigoxin immunotherapy can prove lifesaving. Doses of purified antidigoxin antigen- binding fragments are administered based on the estimated dose of digoxin ingested, or on total body burden. Although rare, recurrence of toxicity can occur, usually 24 to 48 hours after administration of antidigoxin immunotherapy.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI) recommend a number of predischarge pharmacologic interventions to reduce mortality risk, including antiplatelet agents (aspirin plus a platelet \(\mathrm{P2Y}_{12}\) receptor antagonist), a beta blocker, a high- dose HMG- CoA reductase inhibitor, and an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, especially when left ventricular dysfunction is present. For acute MI patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of \(40\%\) or less and clinical heart failure or diabetes, the addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is recommended based on the results of the EPHESUS trial. This study showed that compared with placebo, the mineralocorticoid antagonist eplerenone resulted in a \(15\%\) decrease in death from any cause and reduced hospitalizations for cardiovascular events. The recent PARADISE- MI trial did not show a benefit of sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure.  

Implantation of a defibrillator prophylactically for a low ejection fraction should be deferred until 40 days after a MI based on the results of the DINAMIT trial. The other answer choices (amiodarone, warfarin, or supplementing an ACE inhibitor with the angiotensin receptor antagonist

valsartan) have not demonstrated mortality benefits in the post- MI setting.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 333  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 59: pp, 1122.e1, 1126-1127)  

This radiograph displays an implanted HeartMate 3, a modern- generation, magnetically levitated continuous- flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This centrifugal flow pump is implanted within the chest, with an inflow cannula inserted in the left ventricular apex and an outflow cannula connected to the ascending aorta. Continuous- flow LVADs have a smaller profile, lower weight, and greater durability than earlier- generation pulsatile LVADs, as well as very low mechanical failure rates. The HeartMate 3 continuous- flow LVAD is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use both as a bridge to cardiac transplantation and as permanent destination therapy in patients not eligible for transplantation. The MOMENTUM 3 trial demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with implantation of the HeartMate 3 compared with an axial flow pump (HeartMate II), driven largely by the lesser need for reoperation for pump malfunction, as this device has a very low rate of thrombosis.  

Despite improved pump design and survival, disabling strokes remain a common complication of continuous- flow LVAD therapy, with rates approaching \(10\%\) per year. Device- related infections are the second leading cause of death after cardiac failure. Bacterial pathogens dominate and are found most commonly in the blood or the percutaneous driveline. Device endocarditis requires systemic antibiotics and device explantation. Gastrointestinal bleeding is more common with continuous- flow LVADs compared with earlier- generation pulsatile pumps and may be related to either an acquired von Willebrand factor defect (secondary to shear- related damage of high- molecular- weight von Willebrand factor multimers) or to enhanced development of gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformations (possibly as a consequence of low pulse pressure). Bleeding complications may be further exacerbated by the requirement for both antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy to prevent pump thrombosis and device- related thromboembolism.  

LVAD therapy is associated with a high rate of rightsided heart failure, which may prolong hospitalization and reduce survival. Right- sided heart failure may be the consequence of underlying right- sided heart disease and LVAD- related hemodynamic alterations. A continuous- flow LVAD generates increased right- sided venous return and can produce interventricular septal shifts that can further impair right ventricular performance. Therefore, patients with preoperative right ventricular dysfunction may not be candidates for isolated left- sided mechanical support.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 334  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 101: p. 1882; Fig. 101.13; see also Answer to Question 312)  

Cardiorenal syndrome, or coexistent cardiac and renal dysfunction, is common in patients with heart failure. Furthermore, \(15\%\) to \(30\%\) of patients develop worsening renal insufficiency during a heart failure hospitalization. This patient has several risk factors for deterioration of renal function with heart failure treatment, including older age, diabetes, and baseline renal dysfunction. Management of her apparent diuretic resistance would be aided by delineation of her intravascular hemodynamics with a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter. While there is no role for routine PA catheterization in the management of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), current guidelines recommend consideration of hemodynamic assessment in patients who are refractory to initial therapy, including high-dose or combination diuretics.  

Adding low- dose dopamine has not been shown to improve short- term outcomes in heart failure and may exacerbate this patient's ventricular arrhythmia. Empiric administration of nitroprusside without arterial monitoring is inadvisable, given the patient's hypotension. Ultrafiltration as a rescue strategy in this context would not be a preferred option, based on the results of the CARESS study. This randomized trial of patients with ADHF, worsened renal function, and congestion compared a strategy of ultrafiltration with stepped pharmacologic therapy. Compared with patients treated pharmacologically, those randomized to ultrafiltration showed higher creatinine levels, no significant change in weight, and more adverse effects (e.g., renal failure, bleeding, and IV catheter complications).

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 335  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 69: p. 1343)  

The chest radiographs illustrate a biventricular pacing system, implanted for the purpose of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Three pacing leads are present,

<--- Page Split --->

including standard leads in the right atrium and right ventricle and a third lead placed via the coronary sinus (CS) into a lateral marginal vein for left ventricular (LV) pacing. For patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \(35\%\) or less, prolonged QRS duration on the surface ECG, and symptomatic heart failure (class II to IV) despite optimal medical therapy, there is compelling evidence that CRT, either alone or with defibrillator capability, is associated with improvements in functional capacity, quality of life, and mortality. For example, the RAFT trial of CRT in patients with class II to III heart failure, ejection fraction of \(30\%\) or less, and prolonged QRS complex demonstrated a \(25\%\) reduction in all- cause mortality and a \(32\%\) reduction in heart failure hospitalizations, confirming the results previously shown in Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial—Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy.  

Improvements in ventricular mechanical delay with CRT are associated with reductions in the end- systolic volume index and mitral regurgitation and an augmented LVEF. These data support a potential "reverse remodeling" benefit of CRT in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.  

To date, the QRS complex duration (a marker of delayed electrical activation) is the most extensively validated criterion in selection of patients for CRT. Although it is an imperfect surrogate for mechanical ventricular dyssynchrony, QRS complex duration predicts acute hemodynamic improvement after CRT, especially among patients with left bundle branch block in sinus rhythm.  

Because the LV lead is typically placed over the surface of the left ventricle via a CS branch, inadvertent phrenic nerve stimulation and diaphragmatic pacing may complicate device implantation.  

To achieve the clinical and hemodynamic benefits of CRT, biventricular pacing must be continuous. This is in distinction to isolated right ventricular apical pacing, a mode that can contribute to dyssynchrony and a higher risk of heart failure symptoms.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 58: pp. 1110-1111)  

Indications for a permanent pacemaker include symptomatic bradycardia, Mobitz type 2 second- degree heart block, high- grade atrioventricular (AV) block, and third- degree heart block. Cessation of beta blocker therapy is unlikely to lead to reversal of high- grade AV block, which usually results from infra- Hisian conduction disease. Moreover, the patient has a strong indication to remain on a beta blocker for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.  

In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \(50\%\) or less who are likely to require more than \(40\%\) right ventricular pacing, a biventricular pacemaker is recommended to reduce the incidence of right ventricular pacing- induced cardiomyopathy. The Biventricular vs. Right Ventricular Pacing in Heart Failure Patients with Atrioventricular Block (BLOCK- HF) trial randomized patients with high degree atrioventricular block, New York Heart Association Class I to III heart failure, and LVEF of \(50\%\) or less to either biventricular pacing or right ventricular pacing. Over an average of 37 months of follow- up, there was a \(26\%\) reduction in the primary composite outcome (all- cause mortality, heart failure exacerbation, or a \(15\%\) or more increase in left ventricular end- systolic volume index) in patients randomized to biventricular pacing. Thus, in this patient with reduced ejection fraction of \(40\%\) and likely high ventricular pacing demand in the setting of high- grade atrioventricular block, a cardiac resynchronization strategy is most appropriate.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 337  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 46: p. 911; Table 46.3)  

Systolic dysfunction sets into motion a cascade of neurohormonal events that promote ventricular remodeling and progressive left ventricular cavity enlargement. As a consequence, cardiomegaly is common in patients with heart failure and reduced systolic function. However, many patients develop heart failure without systolic dysfunction. This group of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) comprises a diverse group of patients with primary diastolic heart failure, pericardial disease, valvular heart disease, hypertrophic heart disease, or primary restrictive cardiomyopathy. These syndromes present with signs and symptoms of heart failure typically in the absence of cardiomegaly.  

The Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction treatment trial demonstrated that the physical examination carries important prognostic information in patients with heart failure. In particular, elevated jugular venous pressure and a third heart sound are each independently associated with adverse outcomes, including progression of heart failure.  

Pulsus alternans is characterized by a regular rhythm with an alternating strong and weak peripheral pulse. It signifies advanced myocardial disease and is likely the result of cyclic alteration in left ventricular stroke volume due to incomplete myocardial recovery after contraction. It often disappears with successful treatment of heart failure.  

The presence of fever in heart failure should always raise the possibility of underlying infection, pulmonary infarction, or infective endocarditis. In severe heart failure, low- grade fever may be seen as a consequence of cutaneous vasoconstriction and impairment of heat loss from sustained adrenergic nervous system activation. Sleep- disordered breathing is common in heart failure and is an independent risk factor for death and need for cardiac transplantation. Central sleep apnea, commonly manifested by Cheyne- Stokes breathing, is present in approximately \(40\%\) of patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, whereas obstructive sleep apnea is

<--- Page Split --->

present in another \(10\%\) . Sleep- disordered breathing causes recurrent apnea- related hypoxemia and sleep arousal, contributing to chronic neurohormonal activation, peripheral vasoconstriction, and reduced cardiac performance.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 338  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 22: p. 396)  

The lung can be divided into three zones on the basis of the relationship between pulmonary arterial, alveolar, and pulmonary venous pressures. In zone 1 (at the apex), the alveolar pressure exceeds both pulmonary arterial and pulmonary venous pressures, so that there is ventilation without perfusion (dead space). In zone 2, alveolar pressure exceeds the venous but not the arterial pressure at some stage of the respiratory cycle. In zone 3, the alveolar pressure does not exceed either arterial or venous pressures. Zone 3 alveoli are therefore the best perfused, and in the upright patient are situated in the dependent areas of the lung.  

Measurement of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure using a balloon- tipped catheter will be misleading if the catheter tip is wedged in a zone 1 or zone 2 arterial branch. In these zones, the wedge pressure measures alveolar pressure rather than the true left atrial pressure. In most spontaneously breathing patients, a flow- directed balloon- tipped catheter is naturally directed to zone 3 (because these areas are best perfused), and the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure is a truer estimate of the left atrial pressure.  

Pulmonary vascular redistribution on the chest radiograph reflects a relative reduction of perfusion of the bases and a relative increase in apical perfusion. This phenomenon is likely due to compression of vessels at the lung bases owing to dependent edema in that zone.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 339  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 60: p. 1136)  

The calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) interfere with T- cell activation and have become the cornerstone of immunosuppression in solid organ transplantation. Despite reducing episodes of rejection and prolonging survival after transplantation, cyclosporine use is associated with a number of potential complications. Hypertension and nephrotoxicity are common, and cyclosporine levels must be monitored carefully to limit progressive renal failure. Adverse gastrointestinal tract side effects include hepatotoxicity and cholelithiasis, leading to dose- dependent abnormalities in liver function tests. Fine tremors, paresthesias, and occasionally seizures are potential neurologic side effects of cyclosporine therapy. Many patients who receive cyclosporine develop hypertrichosis (hirsutism) or gingival hyperplasia. Myelosuppression in transplant patients is most commonly associated with azathioprine, not cyclosporine.   

Tacrolimus has a different side- effect profile. Hirsutism and gingival hyperplasia do not occur with tacrolimus, and this drug is associated with a lower incidence of hypertension and dyslipidemia than cyclosporine. However, hyperglycemia and neurologic toxicity may be more common with tacrolimus.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 47: p. 917; Ch 49: pp. 953, 963-966)  

Acute heart failure syndromes (AHFSs) are responsible for more than 1 million hospitalizations annually in the United States. Systolic blood pressure is usually normal or high \((\geq 180 \text{mm Hg})\) in patients with AHFS regardless of ejection fraction, likely related to enhanced sympathetic tone. Fewer than \(10\%\) of patients are hypotensive \((\leq 90 \text{mm Hg})\) , usually in association with advanced left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and reduced cardiac output (CO). Patients with low CO may benefit hemodynamically from infusion of intravenous inotropes with vasodilating properties, such as the phosphodiesterase- 3 inhibitor milrinone for short- term support. However, milrinone use has not been shown to improve hospital mortality rates and can be associated with hypotension, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia. It should be used only for patients who do not respond to diuretics and noninotropic vasodilators.  

Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) mediates (1) vasoconstriction via binding to the \(\mathrm{V_{1a}}\) receptor on vascular smooth muscle, and (2) free water retention via the \(\mathrm{V_{2}}\) receptor at the renal collecting duct. Vasopressin levels are elevated in both acute and chronic heart failure and are thought to be a major contributor to hyponatremia, an adverse prognostic marker. Tolvaptan, an orally available \(\mathrm{V_{2}}\) receptor antagonist, has been shown to improve the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and to normalize serum sodium concentrations. However, the Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan trial failed to demonstrate a reduction in mortality or rehospitalizations for heart failure with use of this agent.  

Initial management of AHFS with noninvasive ventilation reduces respiratory distress and improves LV function by lowering afterload. Noninvasive mask ventilation may be administered by continuous positive airway pressure or noninvasive intermittent positive- pressure ventilation. The Three Interventions in Cardiogenic Pulmonary Oedema trial demonstrated that noninvasive ventilation improves dyspnea, hypercapnia, and acidosis compared with standard therapy, but does not reduce mortality or the need for intubation in patients with pulmonary edema.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 341  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 47: p. 913)  

Neurohormonal activation is an important aspect of heart failure syndromes. Although initially a beneficial compensatory response to falling cardiac output (CO), sustained neurohormonal activation ultimately contributes to ventricular remodeling and heart failure progression. Neurohormonal modulation is consequently a cornerstone of heart failure treatment.  

Reduced CO in patients with heart failure triggers adrenergic nervous system stimulation and increased norepinephrine (NE) release. The degree of elevation in the plasma NE concentration correlates with the severity of left ventricular dysfunction, and plasma NE levels are a potent predictor of mortality in heart failure patients. Low forward CO also activates the renin-angiotensin system, increasing circulating levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone and promoting salt and water retention. Increased preload and afterload in the failing heart contribute to mechanical atrial and ventricular stretch, which triggers the release of natriuretic peptides. These peptides, in particular atrial natriuretic peptide and B- type natriuretic peptide, promote compensatory vasodilatation and natriuresis. Circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor- alpha, are also increased in heart failure and may contribute to the cachexia seen in patients with end- stage disease.  

In typical patients with heart failure, there is progressive downregulation of cardiac beta- adrenergic receptors, proportional to disease severity, likely mediated by increased circulating NE levels.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 60: pp. 1138, 1141-1142; Fig. 60.5)  

Mortality from infection accounts for approximately \(20\%\) of deaths over the first year after transplantation. Infections in the first postoperative month tend to involve nosocomial bacterial and fungal pathogens. Later post-transplantation infections are more diverse and involve opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex, Candida, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Nocardia, and Toxoplasma gondii.  

CMV infection is one of the most frequent post- transplantation infections. CMV- negative recipients who receive a CMV- positive allograft are at highest risk, but prior seropositivity does not fully protect against this complication. Prophylactic therapy with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP- SMZ) is prescribed to prevent infections by Pneumocystis and T. gondii. For patients allergic to TMP- SMZ, oral atovaquone prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia is commonly prescribed.   

Allograft rejection is a very important potential complication of heart transplantation, but the likelihood is substantially reduced with effective immunosuppression. Immunologic tolerance to the donor organ develops in the recipient over time, making rejection less likely, which permits a gradual decrease in the intensity of immunosuppressive drugs.  

More than 1 year from heart transplantation, the leading cause of death is the development of coronary artery disease in the allograft. It is pathologically distinct from typical atherosclerosis and is associated with intimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cell proliferation that lead to progressive obliteration of the vessel lumen and loss of tertiary branching. Patients with CMV infection appear to be at higher risk. The diagnosis of this complication is established by surveillance angiography, which is typically performed on an annual basis in patients after transplantation.  

Transplant recipients have a markedly increased incidence of various cancers compared with age- matched controls. This increased risk is related to the intensity and chronicity of immunosuppression therapy. Skin cancers are the most common malignancy after transplantation, followed by lymphoproliferative disorders (which are associated with Epstein- Barr virus infection, not CMV). Other common malignancies after transplantation include adenocarcinomas of the prostate, lung, bladder, and kidney.

The intra- aortic balloon (IAB) is a catheter- mounted counterpulsation device that is most commonly inserted percutaneously through the common femoral artery and positioned in the descending aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery. The balloon timing should be adjusted such that inflation occurs at the dicrotic notch of the arterial pressure waveform, which coincides with the timing of aortic valve closure. The resultant diastolic rise in aortic pressure increases coronary blood flow. The IAB is timed to deflate during the isovolumic phase of left ventricular (LV) contraction. That relative reduction of afterload decreases peak LV pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption.  

IAB counterpulsation improves aberrant hemodynamics in cardiogenic shock after cardiac surgery, acute myocardial infarction (MI), or during high-risk coronary interventions. IAB therapy is indicated for stabilization of patients compromised by mechanical complications of acute MI such as mitral regurgitation or ventricular septal defect. IAB may also be useful as a treatment of refractory angina or ventricular arrhythmias and as a means to stabilize critically ill patients awaiting cardiac transplantation before

<--- Page Split --->

insertion of a ventricular assist device. Of note, the SHOCK II trial showed that IAB therapy did not reduce 30- day mortality in comparison with medical therapy among patients with acute MI complicated by cardiogenic shock for whom early revascularization was planned.2 Whether IAB therapy reduces mortality of cardiogenic shock in conditions other than acute MI remains unanswered. Absolute contraindications to the use of an IAB include aortic valve insufficiency and aortic dissection. An IAB should not be inserted via the femoral artery in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm or severe calcific aortioliac or femoral arterial disease.  

Major complications of IAB therapy include limb ischemia, aortic dissection, aortioliac laceration or perforation, and deep wound infection.

Over \(25\%\) of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) develop atrial fibrillation. The risk of thromboembolic complications in patients with HCM is elevated and higher than patients without structural heart disease, independent of the \(\mathrm{CHA}_2\mathrm{DS}_2\) - VASc score. Patients with HCM who develop atrial fibrillation, and who do not have contraindications to anticoagulation therapy, should be initiated on oral anticoagulation with either warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 345  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 64: p. 1225)  

Intravenous administration of adenosine slows the sinus rate and conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, causing transient AV block. Its AV nodal effects, in combination with its extremely short half- life (1.5 seconds), make adenosine a safe and effective drug for the diagnosis and treatment of reentrant supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) involving the AV node. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia nearly always terminate after adenosine administration. In addition, the transient AV block induced by adenosine may help to unmask other underlying supraventricular arrhythmias such as atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter. Because of its short half- life, adenosine must be administered as a rapid intravenous bolus to achieve adequate blood and tissue levels. Short duration of action also implies a brief period of side effects, which differentiates adenosine from other drugs (e.g., beta blockers, calcium channel blockers) that are used to treat SVTs.   

Adenosine may also be helpful in the differentiation of wide- QRS complex tachycardias. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is usually unaffected by adenosine (except rare forms of right ventricular outflow VT), whereas SVT with aberrant conduction will either terminate or be exposed by transient AV block after adenosine. However, a theoretical risk of adenosine use in these patients is acceleration of conduction through an accessory pathway, if one is present, as in patients with Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome. Transient side effects are common with adenosine, occurring in up to \(40\%\) of patients. The most common are dyspnea, chest pressure, and flushing, all of which are fleeting and generally resolve within 1 minute. Adenosine may provoke bronchospasm in patients with severe asthma or obstructive lung disease. Patients after heart transplantation are particularly sensitive to the effects of adenosine, and appropriate caution should be exercised in this population. Because caffeine and theophylline antagonize the adenosine receptor, adenosine is less likely to be effective in patients with recent exposure to these substances.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are common, and their prevalence increases with age. Their frequency may be exacerbated by a variety of factors, including electrolyte imbalances (especially hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia), infection, hypoxia, and excessive use of tobacco, caffeine, or alcohol. In the absence of structural heart disease, isolated PVCs have no impact on survival. Conversely, after myocardial infarction (MI), PVCs identify patients who are at increased risk for ventricular tachycardia or sudden death. In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression trial, the use of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs (encainide and flecainide) to suppress asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias after acute MI was associated with an increased rate of death, and such agents should not be used in the setting of coronary artery disease.  

Approximately \(30\%\) of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia referred for electrophysiologic study are found to have a concealed accessory pathway, most commonly between the left ventricle and the left atrium. These concealed pathways conduct unidirectionally from the ventricles to the atria, but not in the opposite direction. Thus, the ventricle is not preexcited, and the ECG does not demonstrate a delta wave during normal sinus rhythm. Nonetheless, concealed pathways may participate in reentrant AV tachycardias. This mechanism should be suspected during tachycardias when the QRS complex is of normal width (due to anterograde conduction down the atrioventricular node) and the retrograde P wave occurs after completion of the QRS complex, in the ST segment or T wave.

D (Braunwald, Ch 67: p. 1308; Fig. 67.18)The ECG demonstrates right bundle branch block with prominent ST- segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads, typical of Brugada syndrome. This condition can lead to sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation despite the fact that the heart is structurally normal. The clinical presentation is distinguished by male predominance and appearance of arrhythmic events at an average age of 40 years. It is believed that this syndrome accounts for \(40\%\) to \(60\%\) of cases of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. In many families the syndrome segregates in an autosomal dominant fashion and is associated with loss of function mutations in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. Screening of family members, including an ECG, is therefore important. Pharmacologic therapies are not effective in treating ventricular arrhythmias associated with Brugada syndrome. Administration of procainamide may be useful in bringing out the typical electrocardiographic phenotype in patients with a history of aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD) and an equivocal ECG. Implantation of a defibrillator is the therapy of choice for patients with Brugada syndrome with a history of aborted SCD or spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) (class I indication) or history of syncope (class IIa indication). Implantable cardioverter- defibrillator implantation can also be considered for patients with a Brugada pattern on the ECG and inducible VT/VF with two or less extra stimuli at electrophysiologic testing.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 348  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 69: p.1331; see also Answer to Question 321)  

The preferred therapy for survivors of cardiac arrest at risk for recurrence is an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD). Among survivors of out- of- hospital cardiac arrest not associated with a myocardial infarction (MI), the risk of recurrent cardiac arrest after 1 year is \(30\%\) and after 2 years it is approximately \(45\%\) . In the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators trial, ICD implantation resulted in a \(27\%\) relative risk reduction in total mortality over 2 years of follow- up.  

A number of studies directed at the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in high- risk patients have been reported. In those with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction \(\leq 30\%\) ) and prior history of MI, prophylactic ICD implantation is associated with a reduction in all- cause mortality. Defibrillator implantation also reduces death rates in patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure from nonischemic causes. In the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial of patients with class II to III heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to \(35\%\) , ICD implantation reduced overall mortality by \(23\%\) and was superior to amiodarone therapy.   

ICDs are also an appropriate consideration in primary and secondary prevention of SCD in high- risk individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. High- risk features include a history of syncope, a family history of SCD, the presence of marked LV hypertrophy (wall thickness greater than \(30\mathrm{mm}\) ), and the finding of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on noninvasive monitoring.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 349  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 68: p. 1315; Figs. 68.8, 68.9, and 68.12)  

Atrioventricular (AV) block is present when atrial impulses are conducted to the ventricles with abnormal delay or are not conducted at all. There are three categories. First- degree AV block is present when the PR interval is prolonged (>0.20 second) in a constant fashion, and every atrial impulse conducts to the ventricle. In second- degree heart block, some impulses fail to conduct from the atria to the ventricles. Second- degree block is divided into two groups: Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II. In the former type (also termed Wenckebach block), the PR interval progressively increases (and the RR interval usually progressively shortens) until an atrial impulse fails to conduct to the ventricles. In Mobitz type II block, the PR intervals are constant, and without warning there is intermittent failure of an atrial impulse to conduct to the ventricles. Third- degree heart block is present when all atrial impulses fail to conduct to the ventricles, such that the atrial and the ventricular rhythms are independent of one another.  

In first- degree heart block, the delay between atrial and ventricular contraction allows the leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves to drift toward a partially closed position prior to ventricular systole. Therefore, the intensity of the first heart sound is diminished. First- degree heart block and Mobitz type I second- degree heart block often arise in normal healthy adults and well- trained athletes, owing to increased vagal tone.  

Mobitz type I second- degree heart block with a normal QRS duration almost always occurs at the level of the AV node, proximal to the His bundle. Conversely, type II second- degree heart block, especially when accompanied by a bundle branch block QRS morphology, usually reflects a more serious abnormality in the His- Purkinje system.  

In third- degree heart block there is complete AV dissociation. As a result, the ventricular rate is governed not by the atrial rate but by an independent ventricular escape pacemaker. In acquired forms of third- degree heart block, the ventricular rate is usually less than 40 beats/minute. The ventricular rate tends to be faster in patients with congenital complete heart block, approximately 50 beats/minute.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 350  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 61: p. 1151)  

Prolonged ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring of patients engaged in normal daily activity is useful to document the nature and frequency of underlying cardiac arrhythmias and to correlate a patient's symptoms with rhythm disturbances. Although significant rhythm disturbances are uncommon in healthy persons, a variety of arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia (with rates as low as 35 beats/minute), sinus arrhythmia, sinoatrial exit block, type I second- degree atrioventricular block (especially during sleep), and junctional escape complexes may be seen in normal persons. In addition, the prevalence of arrhythmias in normal subjects increases with older age. Persons with ischemic heart disease, especially those recovering from acute myocardial infarction (MI), exhibit ventricular premature beats (VPBs) when long- term recordings of the heart rhythm are obtained. The frequency of VPBs increases over the first several weeks after infarction and decreases approximately 6 months after infarction. Frequent and complex ventricular ectopy is associated with a two- to five- fold increased risk of sudden cardiac death after MI.  

Long- term electrocardiographic recordings are useful for the detection of underlying rhythm disturbances in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as in patients who have unexplained syncope or transient cerebrovascular symptoms. In normal subjects and in patients with underlying rhythm disturbances, the cardiac rhythm may vary dramatically from one long- term recording period to the next.  

On many occasions, the relatively brief period of recording provided by standard Holter monitoring (24- 48 hours) may be inadequate to identify an abnormal rhythm responsible for a patient's symptoms. Longer- term monitoring in such patients, using an external event recorder, may help to establish a diagnosis. For patients with very infrequent symptoms, implantable loop recorders may be appropriate, as they can remain in place for months or years. These devices have proven useful in establishing a diagnosis in patients with recurrent syncope and prior unrevealing evaluations.  

Long- term monitoring has demonstrated a high frequency of asymptomatic recurrences of atrial fibrillation in patients treated for that condition. The frequency of asymptomatic episodes exceeds that of symptomatic episodes, which has important implications for the risk of discontinuing anticoagulant medications.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 351  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 61: p. 1147; Ch 71: p. 1387)  

Syncope may result from vascular, cardiac, neurologic, and metabolic causes. Vascular causes of syncope are the most common, accounting for approximately one- third of all episodes. Vascular causes include orthostatic hypotension and reflex- mediated syncope, such as carotid sinus hypersensitivity and neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope.   

Cardiac abnormalities, including tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias, represent the second most common causes of syncope, accounting for \(10\%\) to \(20\%\) of episodes. Ventricular tachycardia is the rhythm disorder that most frequently causes loss of consciousness. Bradyarrhythmias such as sick sinus syndrome and advanced atrioventricular blocks can also result in syncope, but less commonly. Supraventricular tachycardias are much more likely to present as less severe symptoms such as palpitations or light- headedness rather than loss of consciousness. Although the prognosis of patients with noncardiac causes of syncope tends to be benign, those who have syncope of cardiac origin have a \(30\%\) mortality rate over the next year.  

The history and physical examination are the most important part of the evaluation of patients presenting with syncope. Studies estimate that in up to one- fourth of cases an accurate diagnosis can be made on the basis of history and physical examination alone.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 352  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 69: pp. 1322, 1326, and 1328)  

The most common nomenclature for pacemaker coding uses a four- letter code. The first position reflects the chamber that is being paced (O = none, A = atrium, V = ventricle, D = dual [both atrium and ventricle are paced]); the second position reflects the chamber being sensed (O, A, V, and D, as earlier); the third position corresponds to the response to sensing (O = none, T = triggered, I = inhibited, D = dual); and the fourth position reflects programmability and rate modulation (e.g., O = none, R = rate modulation). As an example, a patient with a dual- chamber, rate- adaptive pacemaker would have a DDDR code.  

Rate- adaptive pacemakers incorporate a sensor that can modulate the pacing rate independently of intrinsic cardiac activity by monitoring physiologic processes such as physical activity or minute ventilation. Mode switching is a useful feature in which the pacemaker mode automatically changes (e.g., from DDDR to DDIR) in response to inappropriate rapid atrial rhythms. This is particularly beneficial for patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, to avoid rapid ventricular pacing during those episodes.  

"Pacemaker syndrome" refers to the deterioration of hemodynamics with associated patient symptoms, or a limitation of optimal functional status, despite a normally functioning pacing system. This is observed most commonly with ventricular inhibited pacing but may occur in any pacing mode in which atrioventricular (AV) synchrony is lost. Patients may experience a sensation of fullness in the head and neck, syncope or presyncope, hypotension, cough, dyspnea, congestive heart failure, or weakness. Physical findings include cannon \(a\) waves in the jugular venous

pulsations and a fall in blood pressure during pacing compared with normal sinus rhythm (Fig. 3.22). Symptomatic AV block of any kind (including Wenckebach) is an indication for permanent pacing. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dual- chamber pacing has been shown to reduce the left ventricular outflow tract gradient and lead to symptomatic improvement in some trials. There is, however, a significant placebo effect from pacing, and other studies have not confirmed clinical benefit. Thus, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines consider pacemaker placement a class IIb indication in patients with medically refractory hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and significant outflow tract obstruction.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 353  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 69: p. 1330; eFig. 69.11)  

Pacemaker- mediated tachycardia (PMT) is a syndrome of upper rate behavior that occurs when there is intact ventri- . culo- atrial conduction resulting in retrograde P waves. If these retrograde P waves are detected by the atrial sensing circuit, the pacemaker atrioventricular interval is initiated, and a paced ventricular contraction follows, which generates another retrograde P, and so on, generating a perpetual "loop." The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient with a dual- chamber device who presents with a paced tachycardia near the maximum tracking limit of the device. It is managed by increasing the postventricular atrial refractory period, which prevents atrial sensing of the retrograde P wave. Because episodes of PMT are often triggered by a premature ventricular complex (PVC), some commercially available devices offer automatic extension of the postventricular refractory period after a PVC.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 354  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 66: p. 1284)  

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in up to \(40\%\) of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular surgery. This dysrhythmia is associated with an increased stroke risk and is the most common cause of prolonged hospitalization after cardiac surgery. Risk factors for postoperative AF include advanced age \(>70\) years), male gender, diabetes, obesity, chronic lung disease, and left ventricular dysfunction. Several antiarrhythmic drugs have been shown to reduce the risk of developing AF after cardiac surgery. Oral beta blockers such as metoprolol lower the risk by \(31\%\) . Other effective prophylactic antiarrhythmic agents are the class III agents amiodarone and sotalol. Digoxin may have a role in rate control of AF when it occurs but has not been shown to prevent postoperative AF. Atrial pacing using temporary electrodes attached to either the right atrium or both atria reduces the probability of postoperative AF. Atorvastatin, an HMG- CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce postoperative AF by \(62\%\) , an effect that is likely independent of its lipid- lowering properties. Other agents that have also been shown in randomized trials to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF are hydrocortisone and colchicine (in patients who tolerate and continue the drug), presumably through their anti- inflammatory effects.

Procainamide, a class IA antiarrhythmic agent, is effective in the management of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. As a sodium channel-blocking agent, it

<--- Page Split --->

acts to depress phase 0 depolarization, thereby slowing conduction. In addition, it has moderate potassium channel- blocking activity (largely owing to the action of its metabolite N- acetyl- procainamide), which leads to slowing of repolarization and prolongation of the action potential duration. A widened QRS complex duration is seen at therapeutic concentrations owing to slowing of conduction in the Purkinje system and ventricular muscle. QT interval prolongation occurs with rising serum concentrations and may precipitate ventricular arrhythmias.  

In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter, procainamide administration may lead to chemical cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm. Otherwise, because procainamide slows the atrial rate, it may facilitate rapid 1:1 conduction through the atrioventricular node and increase the ventricular response rate in atrial flutter or fibrillation unless a nodal blocking agent (e.g., a beta blocker) is coadministered. In patients with AF and Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome, procainamide is effective at prolonging the effective refractory period of the bypass tract and suppresses extranodal atrioventricular conduction.  

Multiple noncardiac side effects of procainamide have been reported, including rashes, myalgias, digital vasculitis, Raynaud phenomenon, gastrointestinal side effects, and central nervous system toxicity. Higher doses of the drug may depress myocardial contractility and diminish myocardial performance; rapid intravenous administration has been associated with hypotension due to a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Chronic administration of procainamide is associated with a positive antinuclear antibody in almost all patients, particularly slow acetylators. However, symptoms of drug- induced lupus (arthritis, arthralgias, pleuritis) occur only in \(15\%\) to \(20\%\) of patients. Many of these patients exhibit positive antihistone antibodies, and the syndrome resolves after drug discontinuation.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 61: pp. 1146, 1156)  

Invasive electrophysiologic study (EPS) is employed for the evaluation of patients with disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. It provides information about the type of rhythm abnormality and its electrophysiologic mechanism. Therapeutically, it is possible during EPS to terminate tachycardias by electrical stimulation, to evaluate the effects of antiarrhythmic therapies, and to ablate myocardium responsible for tachycardias.  

EPS is the gold standard for evaluation of arrhythmic causes of syncope, including the three most common: sinus node dysfunction, His- Purkinje block, and tachyarrhythmias. Of the three, tachyarrhythmias are most reliably initiated in the electrophysiology laboratory, followed by sinus node abnormalities and His- Purkinje block.  

EPS allows the measurement of intracardiac conduction times and the sequence of myocardial activation using catheter electrodes capable of sensing and pacing. In patients with acquired atrioventricular (AV) block and related symptoms, EPS evaluates the length of the His- ventricular (HV) interval, to assess infranodal conduction abnormalities that might prompt pacemaker implantation. HV intervals greater than 55 milliseconds are associated with organic heart disease, a greater likelihood of developing trifascicular block, and higher mortality.   

EPS is helpful in the management of patients with suspected sinus node dysfunction. The sinus node recovery time (SNRT) is used to assess the effects of overdrive suppression on sinus node automaticity. The SNRT is measured by subtracting the spontaneous sinus node cycle length before pacing from the time delay to the first spontaneous sinus response after termination of pacing. Normal values are generally less than 525 milliseconds, and prolongation of the SNRT suggests abnormal sinus node function. Because many patients with impaired sinus node function also exhibit abnormal AV conduction, it is important also to evaluate AV nodal and His- Purkinje function in this population.  

In patients with wide- QRS complex tachycardias, EPS may be used to differentiate supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy from ventricular tachycardia, because the sequence of, and relation between, atrial and ventricular activation can be determined. SVTs are characterized in part by the presence of an HV interval during tachycardia equal to or greater than that recorded during normal sinus rhythm. Shortening of the HV interval during tachycardia suggests either VT or the presence of an accessory pathway. EPS is also used to locate and ablate accessory pathways in preexcitation syndromes. Left lateral accessory pathways are most common (- 50%), followed by posterosepetal, right anteroseptal, and right lateral locations.

Dronedarone is an antiarrhythmic drug derived from amiodarone, and the two agents share electrophysiologic properties, including blockade of the delayed rectifier potassium current, inhibition of the rapid sodium and L- type calcium currents, and antiadrenergic effects. However, unlike amiodarone, dronedarone does not contain iodine molecules, a property that likely accounts for its much lower rate of thyroid and pulmonary toxicity.  

Dronedarone is indicated for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter. It is orally absorbed, is hepatically metabolized, and has a much shorter elimination half- life than amiodarone (13- 19 hours). Like amiodarone, the QT interval may lengthen, but the risk of proarrhythmia is small.  

In the Antiarrhythmic Trial with Dronedarone in Moderate- to- Severe Heart Failure Evaluating Morbidity Decrease (ANDROMEDA), patients on dronedarone had increased mortality compared with those taking a placebo (8.1% vs. 3.8%); thus, the drug should not be used in patients with recent or current heart failure. In addition, in distinction to patients who maintain sinus rhythm on the drug, dronedarone is associated with increased mortality when prescribed to patients who have permanent atrial fibrillation.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 358  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 66: pp. 1281-1283)  

Early techniques of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation were aimed at eliminating sites of initiating premature atrial contractions at their origin deep within the pulmonary veins, the site of origin of AF in many patients. However, only a small number of patients have sufficient atrial premature beats to serve as such a target, and ablation deep within these veins can result in pulmonary vein stenosis. Subsequently, techniques shifted to electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins by creating a circumferential line of block encircling the venous ostia to prevent spread of impulses from the site of initiation to the remainder of the atria. Procedural success rates (freedom from recurrences after 1 year) are \(60\%\) to \(80\%\) in patients with paroxysmal AF and \(40\%\) to \(60\%\) in patients with persistent AF, with lower success rates in patients with longstanding persistent AF. These rates improve with additional follow- up ablation procedures. Success appears to be similar independent of the ablation technique used (radiofrequency catheter or cryoballoon).  

Candidates for AF ablation are those without significant structural heart disease in whom AF interferes with quality of life. Catheter ablation is usually not appropriate for patients with AF who are asymptomatic. For symptomatic patients, it is often appropriate to attempt AF control with at least one antiarrhythmic agent before proceeding to ablation. However, ablation may be appropriate first- line therapy for young individuals with symptomatic AF, those with sinus node dysfunction for whom antiarrhythmic drugs may cause significant bradycardia, and patients who decline to take pharmacologic therapy. Because AF can recur after a successful ablation procedure, the need for ongoing anticoagulation is determined by the risk of stroke as estimated by the \(\mathrm{CHA}_2\mathrm{DS}_2\) - VASc score (summarized in the Answer to Question 359), rather than the presence or absence of symptoms.  

Major complications occur in \(5\%\) to \(6\%\) of patients after catheter ablation for AF. The most common are cardiac  

tamponade, pulmonary vein stenosis, and cerebral thromboembolism, each of which occurs in approximately \(1\%\) of patients. Left atrial- esophageal fistula (not atrial- tracheal fistula) has been reported as a rare, but potentially lethal, complication of ablation in the posterior left atrium.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 359  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 66: pp. 1275-1277)  

Stroke prevention is a major goal of therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Because of the risk of hemorrhage, anticoagulants are reserved for patients with a risk of thromboembolism greater than that of bleeding. Thus, risk estimators have been developed for nonvalvular AF on the basis of clinical history, including the \(\mathrm{CHA}_2\mathrm{DS}_2\) - VASc score, which accurately discriminates between low- risk and intermediate- risk patients. In this scoring system, the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, female gender, vascular disease, and age 65 years or over are each assigned 1 point, while age 75 years and over and prior stroke (or transient ischemic attack) are assigned 2 points each. The higher the number of total points, the greater the stroke risk, and scores greater than 1 in men and greater than 2 in women achieve a class I recommendation for anticoagulation therapy. The patient in this case vignette has a \(\mathrm{CHA}_2\mathrm{DS}_2\) - VASc score of 5 (hypertension, age \(\geq 75\) years, diabetes, and female gender), which corresponds to an annual stroke rate of approximately \(4\%\) (Fig. 3.23), such that initiation of anticoagulation is appropriate.  

If warfarin were chosen as the anticoagulant, the target international normalized ratio for this patient would be 2.0 to 3.0. Antithrombotic therapy with either single- or dual- antiplatelet therapy is insufficient to prevent stroke in this high- risk patient.  

The non- vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors, including apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) have several advantages over vitamin K antagonists,

including fixed dosing regimens that eliminate the need for frequent laboratory testing. These direct oral anticoagulants have been shown to be noninferior or superior to warfarin in efficacy for stroke prevention and have a lower rate on intracranial hemorrhage. Risk factors for bleeding while on oral factor \(\mathrm{Xa}\) inhibitors include small body size, renal dysfunction, and advanced age. For the direct factor \(\mathrm{Xa}\) inhibitor apixaban, the appropriate dose for prevention stroke in nonvalvular AF is \(5\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily. Apixaban \(2.5\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily is recommended for patients with at least two of the following: age 80 years or older, body weight \(60\mathrm{kg}\) or under, or serum creatinine \(1.5\mathrm{mg / dL}\) or more.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 360

Atrial fibrillation (AF) commonly occurs in patients with hypertensive heart disease, hyperthyroidism, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, or after cardiac surgery (in \(25\% - 40\%\) of patients after valve surgery or coronary artery bypass graft surgery). The incidence of AF approximately doubles with each decade of adult life. It is an independent risk factor for mortality, after adjustment for other risk factors, including age, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, rheumatic and nonrheumatic valvular disease, and myocardial infarction. The presence of AF increases the risk of stroke by three- to five- fold.  

Treatment of AF varies depending on the clinical presentation, but includes three components: (1) assessment of the need for, proper timing of, and appropriate method for the restoration of sinus rhythm; (2) anticoagulation to prevent embolic stroke; and (3) medication to control the ventricular rate (to reduce symptoms and prevent the development of tachycardia- related cardiomyopathy). Several randomized studies have demonstrated that a strategy of sinus rhythm maintenance with antiarrhythmic drugs offers no survival advantage over a strategy of long- term rate control in patients with AF and that long- term anticoagulation is imperative in all high- risk patients to prevent thromboembolic complications.  

In patients presenting with AF of less than 48 hours' duration, electrical or chemical cardioversion for restoration of sinus rhythm can be performed without the need for prolonged anticoagulation. In those presenting with AF of longer duration, anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks is advised before cardioversion, given the potential for dislodging formed thrombus within the left atrial appendage. If intra- atrial thrombus is first excluded by transesophageal echocardiography or cardiac CT imaging, more expeditious cardioversion may be safely performed in these patients.

## B (Braunwald, Ch.62: pp. 1163, 1175.e1; eFigs. 62.1 and 62.8; Fig. 62.2)  

The sinus node is composed of nodal cells, transitional cells, and atrial muscle cells and is richly innervated by both postganglionic adrenergic and cholinergic nerve terminals. Vagal stimulation releases acetylcholine and slows the discharge rate of the sinus node, whereas adrenergic stimulation releases norepinephrine and speeds the discharge rate.  

The arterial supply to the atrioventricular node arises from a branch of the right coronary artery in \(85\%\) to \(90\%\) of human hearts and from a branch of the circumflex in \(10\%\) to \(15\%\) . The upper muscular interventricular septum is supplied by both the anterior and posterior descending arteries.  

Phase 3 (final rapid depolarization) of the cardiac action potential results from activation of repolarizing \(\mathrm{K}^+\) currents and inactivation of the inward calcium current. Interference with potassium currents by genetic mutation or drugs can result in prolongation of the QT interval. For example, a number of medications, including erythromycin, terfenadine, and ketoconazole, can inhibit the delayed rectifier \(\mathrm{K}^+\) current \((\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}})\) , resulting in an acquired form of the long QT syndrome, thereby predisposing to the ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes.  

Phase 4 of the action potential represents the resting membrane potential in cardiac myocytes. During this phase, a set of potassium membrane channels are open, while other ionic channels are essentially impermeable to flow, such that the resting transmembrane potential of a ventricular myocyte is primarily determined by the equilibrium potential of potassium, at approximately - 91 mV.

## E (Braunwald, Ch 64: pp. 1220-1222)  

Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat and suppress a wide spectrum of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The onset of action of the intravenous form is within 1 to 2 hours. After oral administration, the onset of action is delayed by days or weeks but is shortened by large loading doses. Elimination is primarily by hepatic excretion into bile with some enterohepatic recirculation. Renal elimination of amiodarone is negligible, and the dose does not need to be adjusted in the presence of renal insufficiency. Amiodarone's elimination half-life is multiphasic, with an initial \(50\%\) reduction in plasma concentration 3 to 10 days after drug cessation,

<--- Page Split --->

followed by a terminal half- life ranging from 26 to 107 days, with a mean of approximately 53 days.  

Unlike many other antiarrhythmic drugs, amiodarone is tolerated by patients with left ventricular dysfunction and it is not associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure. However, all prospective, randomized comparisons have shown that implanted defibrillators are superior for the prevention of sudden cardiac death in this population.  

Amiodarone is associated with a number of significant extracardiac toxicities. Of great significance is the development of pulmonary toxicity, which may reflect a hypersensitivity reaction. This complication can occur as early as 6 days after amiodarone's initiation or may appear after long- term use.  

Additional adverse effects of amiodarone include hepatic toxicity, neurologic dysfunction, photosensitivity, and bluish skin discoloration. Both hypothyroidism \((2\% - 4\%)\) and hyperthyroidism \((1\% - 2\%)\) have been reported with the use of this drug. Amiodarone is not associated with hyperparathyroidism or disturbances of calcium homeostasis. Corneal deposits, visualized by slit lamp examination, occur in almost all patients who are treated with amiodarone for more than 6 months, but resultant visual impairment is unusual. Optic neuritis is a more serious potential adverse ophthalmic effect but is very rare.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 363  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 62: pp. 1186-1188)  

Mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias can be classified into those of disordered impulse formation (e.g., abnormal automaticity, triggered activity) and those of disordered impulse conduction (e.g., conduction blocks, reentry). Common examples of reentry include atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), and atrial flutter.  

AVNRT arises from reentry involving dual atrioventricular (AV) nodal pathways. In the common form of AVNRT, the anterograde conduction occurs down the "slow" pathway, and retrograde conduction occurs up the "fast" pathway. As a result, retrograde P waves on the ECG are typically superimposed on the terminal portion of the QRS complex. In the uncommon form of AVNRT, anterograde conduction occurs down the "fast" pathway, and retrograde conduction is delayed as it proceeds up the "slow" pathway. Thus, in this form, retrograde P waves occur later, after the QRS complex.  

In most cases of AVRT due to preexcitation, such as those in Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome, the accessory pathway conducts more rapidly than the normal AV node but takes a longer time to recover excitability (i.e., the accessory pathway has a longer anterograde refractory period than the AV node). The consequence is that a premature atrial complex may be blocked in the accessory pathway, continue to the ventricle over the normal AV node and His bundle, and return to the atrium retrograde via the accessory pathway. This creates a continuous conduction loop for generation of a narrow- complex, orthodromic AVRT. In antidromic AVRT, anterograde conduction to the ventricles occurs down the accessory pathway with retrograde conduction up the AV node, resulting in a wide- QRS complex tachycardia.   

The typical form of atrial flutter ("counterclockwise" flutter) is due to reentry within the right atrium. Radiofrequency ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus often interrupts the reentrant pathway and eliminates recurrences of the arrhythmia.  

Ventricular tachycardias can be caused by numerous mechanisms, including reentry (e.g., bundle branch reentry), triggered activity (e.g., right ventricular outflow tachycardia), or abnormal automaticity.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 364  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 63: pp. 1201-1203)  

In the absence of structural heart disease or coronary artery anomalies, a history of recurrent, externally related syncope in a young person is of concern for a predisposition to ventricular dysrhythmias. His ECG during exercise confirms the likely cause of syncope with the onset of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. This constellation of findings, the family history of sudden cardiac death during exertion, and the normal corrected QTc interval at rest suggests the diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), an inherited form of ventricular tachycardia. CPVT is triggered by stress, which first induces sinus tachycardia, followed by ventricular premature beats, then by polymorphic or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, as shown in Figure 3.7. Approximately \(30\%\) of CPVT patients have a family history of sudden death or stress- induced syncope. Mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene have been linked to an autosomal dominant form of CPVT that accounts for half of all cases.  

The treatment of choice for CPVT is beta blocker therapy (to blunt the impact of catecholamine surges), along with an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator for prevention of sudden death. Patients with CPVT should be counseled to avoid vigorous exercise. Cardiac sympathectomy has been reported to be effective in some cases but is not considered first- line therapy. Magnesium has not been shown to be effective in patients with CPVT.

## E (Braunwald, Ch 66: pp. 1279-1280)  

Before initiating antiarrhythmic drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm, precipitating or reversible causes of atrial fibrillation should be considered and addressed. The selection of an antiarrhythmic drug must take into account the underlying heart condition and comorbidities that may increase specific drug toxicities.

<--- Page Split --->

Dofetilide, an oral class III agent approved for the treatment of atrial flutter and fibrillation, acts by blocking the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current \(\mathrm{(I_{K})}\) , thereby prolonging repolarization. The most important adverse effect is torsades de pointes, which occurs in \(2\%\) to \(4\%\) of patients. The greatest risk of torsades is at the time of drug initiation, so drug loading must occur in a hospitalized setting with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. The risk of torsades can be reduced by calculating the drug's appropriate dose based on the patient's creatinine clearance and by monitoring the QT interval.  

Sotalol is a nonspecific beta blocker that also prolongs repolarization. It should be used cautiously in patients with reduced contractile function because its negative inotropic effect may cause a further decline in cardiac index and precipitate heart failure. The most common and serious cardiac side effect of sotalol use is proarrhythmia; new or worsened ventricular tachyarrhythmias occur in approximately \(4\%\) of cases, and this complication is due to torsades de pointes in approximately \(2.5\%\) . Sotalol is primarily eliminated via the kidney and should be avoided in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.  

Disopyramide, a class IA drug, is a negative inotrope that can exacerbate heart failure symptoms and is contraindicated in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction.  

Dronedarone is a class III agent similar to amiodarone but with fewer extracardiac side effects. However, dronedarone should not be prescribed to patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure, as it has been associated with increased mortality in this population.  

Despite the many potential extracardiac side effects of amiodarone (as described in the Answer to Question 362), it is generally well tolerated in patients with systolic dysfunction, does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency, and, unlike other class III antiarrhythmic drugs, can typically be initiated in an outpatient setting, because torsades de pointes rarely occurs with this agent. Monitoring of thyroid function, liver function tests, and pulmonary symptoms is required during long- term amiodarone administration. The lowest effective maintenance dose of amiodarone should be used to minimize adverse effects.  

premature stimulus would merely extinguish in the AV node. In this case, the slowed conduction through the AV node initiates a narrow- complex tachycardia. Such a "jump" in the AH interval during rapid atrial pacing is the electrophysiologic signature of dual atrioventricular (AV) nodal physiology. Examination of the sequence of atrial activation in the subsequent tachycardia reveals that the earliest atrial activation is in the His bundle recording (low right atrium, HBE lead), later progressing to the high right atrium and CS (reflecting left atrial activation). These features identify this rhythm as an AV nodal reentrant tachycardia.

The electrogram depicted demonstrates spontaneous infrahisian block, consistent with infrahisian conduction disease. Four QRS complexes are shown, with two surface electrocardiographic leads \(\mathrm{(V_1}\) and \(\mathrm{V_5}\) ), three His catheter electrograms (proximal, mid-, and distal pole), and a right ventricular electrogram. The surface ECG shows right bundle branch block and sinus rhythm with a single dropped beat after the second QRS complex. After the second QRS complex, deflections are present on the three His catheter channels, representing atrial depolarization. This event is followed by a small, sharp deflection evident only on the distal His channel, representing the His electrogram. That His bundle deflection fails to conduct to the ventricles because there is no QRS complex immediately following it. Together with bifascicular block evident on the surface ECG, this is a class I indication for permanent pacing.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 65: pp. 1260-1261)  

The figure depicts the initiation of a narrow- complex tachycardia during electrophysiologic study by rapid atrial pacing from the coronary sinus (CS). A train of stimuli is delivered at a cycle length of 500 milliseconds \((\mathrm{S_1})\) followed by a premature stimulus \((\mathrm{S_2})\) at an \(\mathrm{S_1 - S_2}\) interval of 250 milliseconds. The effects of this premature stimulus on intracardiac conduction are seen in the His bundle recording (HBE). The AH interval, reflecting the conduction time from the atrium to the His bundle, is markedly prolonged after the premature stimulus, increasing to 300 milliseconds. This occurs because, in this patient with dual atrioventricular (AV) nodal pathways, the premature atrial stimulus encounters a refractory fast pathway and conducts anterograde through the slow pathway instead. In a patient without such dual AV nodal pathways, the

The differential diagnosis of wide- QRS complex tachycardia includes ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy. Several features of the clinical history and surface ECG may assist in this differentiation, although none is absolute. The clinical scenario is important, because a history of myocardial infarction makes the diagnosis of VT more likely. On the ECG, the presence of fusion beats (which indicate activation of the ventricle from two different foci, one of ventricular origin), capture beats (intermittent narrow- complex QRS at an interval shorter than the rate of tachycardia), or atrioventricular dissociation all support the diagnosis of VT. Concordance of the QRS complex in the precordial leads (all complexes are positively directed or all are negatively directed) favors VT over SVT. Slowing or termination of the

<--- Page Split --->

tachycardia by vagal maneuvers is consistent with SVT. Hemodynamic stability is not a useful criterion for differentiating SVT from VT.  

Specific QRS contours are also helpful. For example, a triphasic QRS complex (rSR') in lead \(\mathrm{V}_1\) supports the presence of SVT. Conversely, monophasic or biphasic QRS complexes in lead \(\mathrm{V}_1\) are more consistent with VT. VT with a left bundle branch block configuration typically demonstrates a small Q- large R (qR) or QS pattern in lead \(\mathrm{V}_6\) and a broad, prolonged ( \(>40\) milliseconds) R wave in lead \(\mathrm{V}_1\) . VT with a right bundle branch pattern demonstrates a monophasic or biphasic QRS in lead \(\mathrm{V}_1\) and small R- large S waves or QS complexes in lead \(\mathrm{V}_6\) .  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 369  

## A (Braunwald, Ch 66: pp. 1277-1279)  

Electrical cardioversion is very effective for termination of supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly those due to reentry. The cardioversion of tachycardias caused by disorders of enhanced automaticity is less successful. For example, ectopic atrial tachycardia and other arrhythmias caused by disorders of impulse formation typically recur within seconds after the electrical discharge.  

Except in patients with ventricular fibrillation or rapid ventricular flutter, a synchronized shock (delivered during the QRS complex) should be used to minimize the risk of firing on the ST segment or T wave, which might precipitate ventricular fibrillation. The minimal effective energy should be employed initially to reduce the risk of myocardial damage, with upward titration as required. If the "maximum" energy level of the electrical cardioverter fails to terminate the abnormal rhythm, repeated shocks at the same energy level can decrease the chest wall impedance and may succeed. Treatment with the class III intravenous agent ibutilide may convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm, and when used as pretreatment also enhances the success of subsequent electrical cardioversion. Direct- current cardioversion is contraindicated in suspected digital- is- induced tachyarrhythmias because of the potential of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia.  

After successful cardioversion, anticoagulation should be continued for an additional 3 to 4 weeks, because full recovery of atrial mechanical activity often lags behind the return of normal electrical function, and persistent blood stasis could permit thrombus formation.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 370  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 67: pp. 1306-1308)  

The arrhythmia in the figure is torsades de pointes, a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that may develop in patients with delayed ventricular repolarization, manifest by a prolonged QT interval on the ECG. Torsades de pointes is thought to be triggered by early afterdepolarizations during the vulnerable period of ventricular repolarization, producing QRS complexes of changing amplitude twisting around the isoelectric line at a rate of 200 to 250 beats/minute.  

A prolonged corrected QT interval on the surface ECG is defined as greater than 0.46 millisecond in men or greater than 0.47 millisecond in women. A long QT interval, the electrocardiographic substrate for torsades de pointes, can be either congenital or acquired. Congenital forms include those associated with congenital severe bradycardia or loss of function mutations in the KCNQ1 (LQT1) and KCNQ2 (LQT2) potassium channel genes or a gain- of- function mutation in the SCN5A sodium channel gene, which is responsible for LTQ3. Loss- of- function mutations in the SNC5A gene (which result in accelerated sodium channel recovery or inactivated sodium channels) are associated with Brugada syndrome (and ventricular fibrillation) rather than prolongation of the QT interval and torsades de pointes.  

Multiple drugs, both in toxic and therapeutic doses, can result in prolongation of the QT interval and an increased risk of torsades de pointes, including tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, and erythromycin. Antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the QT interval and predispose to torsades de pointes include quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, sotalol, and dofetilide. Electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, may also contribute to a long QT interval and torsades de pointes.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 371  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 67: pp. 1293-1294)  

Intracardiac electrograms are shown depicting electrical activity in the high right atrium (HRA), in the bundle of His (His proximal and His distal), and at the right ventricular apex. The surface electrocardiographic leads \(\mathrm{V}_1\) and \(\mathrm{V}_5\) also are shown. The surface ECG demonstrates a wide- complex tachycardia at approximately 140 beats/minute with a right bundle branch block morphology. The His distal and right ventricular apical electrograms show deflections corresponding to each QRS complex, which represent ventricular depolarization. Smaller, periodic deflections at a slower rate are evident on the HRA and His proximal electrograms that represent atrial depolarizations. The lack of relationship between the atrial and ventricular depolarizations confirms the presence of atrioventricular dissociation. Thus, this rhythm represents ventricular tachycardia.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 372  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 68: pp. 1315-1317; Fig. 68.8)  

The electrophysiologic tracing in the figure depicts Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second- degree atrioventricular (AV) block. This is evident both in the surface electrocardiographic channel, which demonstrates progressive PR interval prolongation followed by a nonconducted P wave, and in the His bundle tracing (HBE), which shows progressive AH interval prolongation followed by block within the

<--- Page Split --->

AV node. In contrast, in patients with Mobitz type II second- degree heart block, there would be sudden block of impulse conduction (a P wave not followed by a QRS complex) without prior lengthening of the PR interval.  

Type I second- degree AV block with normal QRS duration almost always reflects block at the level of the AV node proximal to the His bundle and typically portends a benign clinical course, and no specific intervention is indicated in the absence of symptoms. When type I AV block occurs in acute myocardial infarction (MI), it is usually in the setting of an inferior wall infarction. Such occurrences are usually transient and do not typically require therapy. The presence of higher degrees of AV block, including type II second- degree block, in acute MI indicates greater myocardial damage and predicts higher mortality.  

Vagal maneuvers, such as carotid sinus massage, may enhance type I AV block by further prolonging AV nodal conduction and may therefore be useful in differentiating type I from type II AV block.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 373  

## E (Braunwald, Ch 68: p. 1319)  

Acquired atrioventricular (AV) blocks are most commonly idiopathic and related to aging. However, many defined conditions can impair AV conduction, including coronary artery disease, infections (e.g., Lyme disease, Chagas disease, endocarditis), collagen vascular diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, dermatomyositis), infiltrative diseases (e.g., sarcoid, amyloid), neuromuscular disorders, and drug effects.  

Indications for permanent pacing in AV conduction disorders include (1) permanent or intermittent complete (third- degree) heart block, (2) permanent or intermittent type II second- degree AV block, and (3) type I second- degree AV block if accompanied by symptoms or evidence of block at, or inferior to, the bundle of His.  

Pacing is not indicated in asymptomatic first- degree AV block or type I second- degree AV block proximal to the bundle of His. Occasionally, patients with first- degree AV block with marked prolongation of the PR interval \(>300\) milliseconds) are hemodynamically symptomatic because of the loss of effective AV synchrony. In that case, consideration of a pacemaker is appropriate if reversible contributors to the AV block are not identified. Because of vagal influences, many normal persons (particularly those with high resting vagal tone, such as conditioned athletes) may exhibit pauses significantly longer than 3 seconds during sleep; in and of itself, therefore, this finding is not sufficient to warrant permanent pacemaker implantation.  

Controversy exists about the appropriateness of permanent pacing in adults with asymptomatic congenital complete heart block. Because of the high incidence of unpredictable syncope, the tendency is to implant permanent pacemakers in adults with this condition (class IIb indication).

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 374  

## B (Braunwald, Ch 69: pp. 1328-1330; Table 69.2)  

Some dual- chamber pacemakers operate with unipolar leads, as in this case. The metal capsule of the generator serves as the indifferent electrode. This can result in oversensing, in which skeletal muscle potentials result in inappropriate inhibition or triggering of pacing.  

The first two beats in the tracing show appropriate dual- chamber atrial and ventricular sensing and pacing at a rate of 70 beats/minute. There is no evidence of lack of capture (all pacing stimuli cause myocardial depolarizations) or undersensing (because there are no native atrial or ventricular complexes).  

After the third complex there is a long pause during which no pacemaker activity is observed. There is significant baseline artifact (due to muscle contractions) during this period. The lack of pacemaker activity during the pause indicates that the ventricular lead has sensed the electrical activity generated by the arm and chest muscles and has inappropriately inhibited pacemaker output.  

In cases of suspected oversensing, placing the pacemaker in an asynchronous mode (with application of a magnet) will abolish the symptoms caused by pacemaker malfunction and aid in the diagnosis. Conversion of the lead system to a bipolar configuration frequently eliminates oversensing of myopotentials.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 375  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 69: p. 1329; Table 69.2)  

The figure is an electrocardiographic tracing from a patient with a dual- chamber pacemaker. Atrial pacing artifacts with effective atrial depolarization are seen throughout the tracing. However, all but one ventricular pacing artifact (complex 5) fail to result in ventricular depolarization. Because the pacemaker generates appropriate output but not consistent, effective ventricular depolarization, this is an example of intermittent failure to capture of the ventricular lead.  

Failure to capture most commonly occurs due to dislodgment of the pacemaker lead from the endocardial surface, a complication that usually occurs within the first few weeks after implantation. Modern designs for active and passive fixation of pacemaker leads are associated with a low frequency of lead dislodgement. Failure to capture may also occur due to a lead insulation break, which allows some of the electrode current to dissipate into the surrounding tissues. Even if the lead system is intact and in contact with the myocardium, failure to capture may occur if the pacing threshold required to depolarize the myocardium exceeds the programmed voltage amplitude and pulse duration. This can occur in the setting of exit block, in which an inflammatory reaction or fibrosis at the electrode- myocardium interface raises the depolarization threshold; the risk of this complication is greatly reduced using a steroid- eluting lead. Pacing thresholds (and the likelihood of failure to capture) may also be increased in the setting of marked metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyperkalemia) or therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., flecainide).  

Impending total battery depletion may also result in a subthreshold pacing stimulus and failure to capture.

<--- Page Split --->

Total battery depletion usually results in complete failure to output, which is not the case here, because consistent atrial and ventricular pacing and atrial capture are seen. In patients with a unipolar pacemaker, air in the pacemaker pocket may act as an insulator and reduce the effective pacemaker output, resulting in noncapture.  

A loose set screw (which helps secure the lead to the generator) is a cause of failure to output, but not failure to capture. That diagnosis is inconsistent with this tracing because consistent ventricular pacing artifacts are seen.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 376  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 68: pp. 1312-1314, 1320)  

There are several forms of bradycardia related to sinus node function. Sinus bradycardia is defined as a sinus node discharge of less than 60 beats/minute. It is generally a benign arrhythmia and is well tolerated in most patients. It can result from excessive vagal stimulation or decreased sympathetic discharge and is common in well- trained athletes. During sleep, the heart rate in normal individuals can decrease to 35 to 40 beats/minute, and pauses of 2 to 3 seconds or even longer are not uncommon. Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia does not require specific therapy. Symptomatic patients can be treated acutely with intravenous atropine (which increases the sinus node discharge rate) or sympathetic stimulants. For chronic, symptomatic sinus bradycardia, electronic pacing may be required.  

Carotid sinus hypersensitivity can be cardioinhibitory (ventricular asystole \(>3\) seconds during carotid sinus stimulation) or vasodepressor (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure \(>50\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) ). Atropine is a competitive muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist that blocks cardioinhibitory input to the sinus node. Atropine transiently abolishes cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity, but most symptomatic patients require permanent pacemaker placement.  

Sick sinus syndrome encompasses a number of sinus node abnormalities including persistent spontaneous sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest or exit block, combinations of sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction disturbances, and alternations of paroxysmal rapid atrial tachyarrhythmias with periods of slow atrial rates. Sinus arrest (which is distinct from sinus exit block) is identified by a pause in the sinus rhythm and a PP interval surrounding the pause that is not a multiple of the underlying PP rate. Sinus arrest can be due to sinus node ischemia during an acute myocardial infarction, degenerative fibrotic changes, digitalis toxicity, or excessive vagal tone. A large proportion of patients with sleep apnea have periods of sinus arrest as well as atrioventricular block.  

Sinus arrhythmia is defined as phasic variations in the sinus cycle length, and it can appear in two forms: respiratory and nonrespiratory. In the respiratory form, the PP interval shortens in a cyclical fashion during inspiration owing to inhibition of vagal tone. In the nonrespiratory form, as seen in digitalis toxicity, the phasic variation is unrelated to the respiratory cycle. Symptoms are uncommon, and therapy is generally not necessary.

## C (Braunwald, Ch 67: pp. 1299, 1302; Table 67.1; Fig. 67.15)  

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is depicted by fatty or fibrofatty infiltration of the right ventricular (RV) wall. Clinically, the disease is characterized by life- threatening ventricular arrhythmias in otherwise healthy- appearing young people, afflicting males most commonly. The prevalence is estimated at 1 in 5000 individuals, although the difficulty of diagnosis makes the true prevalence difficult to estimate. In its familial form, mutations have been identified in genes that encode desmosomal proteins (e.g., plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and others). Immunohistochemistry of desmosomal proteins in endomyocardial biopsy samples has been shown to be a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for ARVC. Most patients with ARVC demonstrate RV abnormalities by echocardiography, computed tomography, RV angiography, or magnetic resonance imaging. In advanced forms, the left ventricle may be involved.  

The ECG in patients with ARVC in sinus rhythm may demonstrate a complete or incomplete right bundle branch block, with a terminal notch in the QRS complex, known as an epsilon wave (see arrowheads in Fig. 3.24). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs commonly in patients with ARVC, usually with a left bundle branch block morphology due to its RV origin (see Braunwald, Fig. 67.15).  

As a result of the progressive nature of this disease and the multiple morphologies of the VT it produces, radiofrequency catheter ablation is not often successful. An implantable cardioverter- defibrillator is usually the treatment of choice, even in asymptomatic patients.

Cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) infections are increasing in incidence and are more common after a generator change than at the time of initial implantation. The organisms responsible for early infections are typically gram- positive cocci derived from the skin, predominantly staphylococcal species. Pocket infections can present with pain, erythema, purulent discharge, and/or generator or lead erosion. Septic pulmonary emboli may be the first manifestation. Patients with evidence of an infection of a CIED, including localized pocket infections without evidence of systemic involvement, should undergo complete removal of the system hardware (generator and leads). The risk of transvenous lead extraction increases the longer the lead has been in place.

Surgical or percutaneous device exclusion of the LAA may reduce thromboembolic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), especially in those who are not candidates for long- term anticoagulation. One such US Food and Drug Administration- approved LAA percutaneous occlusion device (WATCHMAN, a fenestrated fabric- covered nitinol plug implanted via the femoral vein with transseptal catheterization) was demonstrated to be noninferior to warfarin for stroke prevention, with a lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke, in long- term follow- up. At present, implantation of this device requires short- term anticoagulation for 45 days, followed by transesophageal echocardiographic confirmation that there is no residual peridevice flow. Approximately \(95\%\) of patients are able to discontinue anticoagulation at that time.  

This patient is at high risk for stroke (CHA \(_2\) DS \(_2\) - VASc score is 4, with 1 point for hypertension, 1 point for diabetes, and 2 points for age \(\geq 75\) years), such that aspirin alone would be insufficient to reduce stroke risk. The patient has also had recurrent falls and repetitive gastrointestinal bleeding that increase the risk for bleeding events on anticoagulation, such that implantation of an LAA closure device is a reasonable option.  

Enoxaparin is typically used as a temporary bridge for some patients during warfarin interruption. In chronic kidney disease, the elimination of enoxaparin is prolonged, the bleeding risk is increased, and it would not be an appropriate choice for this patient's chronic anticoagulation. Like other novel oral anticoagulants, the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban is noninferior or superior to warfarin for prevention of thromboemboli in patients with nonvalvular AF, while causing less major bleeding. It may be a safer option than warfarin for this patient, but the appropriate dose would be \(2.5\mathrm{mg}\) twice daily (age \(\geq 80\) years, creatinine \(\geq 1.5\mathrm{mg / dL}\) ). Atrioventricular nodal ablation is useful for symptomatic patients with AF and persistently rapid ventricular rates, but the procedure does not reduce the risk of stroke.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 65: pp. 1264-1267; Fig. 65.27)  

The two intracardiac electrograms include surface electrocardiographic leads \(\mathrm{V}_1\) and \(\mathrm{V}_5\) , a recording from a catheter in the high right atrium, a series of five recordings from a multiple- pole catheter placed in the coronary sinus (CS; displayed from the proximal to distal CS), recordings from a bundle of His position catheter (His proximal and His distal), and a recording from a catheter at the right ventricular (RV) apex.  

The baseline electrogram demonstrates preexcitation: the surface ECG shows that the QRS complex occurs nearly simultaneously with the small, sharp His potential deflection on the His distal electrogram. This implies that ventricular activation occurs well before depolarization of the His-Purkinje system.  

In the electrogram recorded during tachycardia, the surface ECG leads show a narrow- complex rhythm at approximately 160 beats/minute. The intracardiac electrograms

<--- Page Split --->

demonstrate ventricular depolarizations at the His and RV apical catheters corresponding to the QRS complex on each surface ECG. Each ventricular depolarization is preceded by a His depolarization. Atrial depolarization is apparent in the His catheter positions and throughout the CS electrograms. The sequence of atrial activation begins at the distal CS electrogram and proceeds to the proximal and His catheters. These observations are consistent with orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia via an accessory pathway. Specifically, the location of the accessory pathway is likely to be left lateral based on the sequence of atrial activation.

## B (Braunwald, Ch 63: pp. 1191-1193)  

Congenital long QT syndromes (LQTS) are inherited disorders characterized by delayed repolarization of the myocardium (QTc \(>480\) milliseconds) and susceptibility to life- threatening ventricular arrhythmias (torsades de pointes). Hundreds of causal mutations have been identified in at least 12 LQTS susceptibility genes.  

Approximately \(75\%\) of disease- causing mutations occur in three genes, comprising the most common forms of this condition: LQT1 (mutations in the KCNQ1 gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the \(\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{ks}}\) potassium channel, causing loss of function), LQT2 (mutations in KCNH2, the gene that encodes the alpha subunit of the \(\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}}\) potassium channel, causing loss of function), and LQT3 (mutations in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the cardiac sodium channel, causing gain of function).  

Clinical symptomatology in LQTS is highly variable and is related in part to the genetic locus that is affected. LQT1 patients experience the majority of cardiac events during physical (especially swimming) or emotional stress, suggesting a connection with sympathetic nervous system activation. In contrast, LQT2 patients are at highest risk for lethal events by auditory triggers or during the postpartum period. Cardiac events during sleep or at rest are most common in LQT3.  

For patients who have congenital LQTS but no history of syncope, ventricular arrhythmias, or family history of sudden cardiac death, generally no therapy or treatment with a beta blocker (to reduce triggered activity) is appropriate. Permanent pacing is indicated in select patients with atrioventricular block or pause- dependent torsades de pointes. In patients deemed at high risk for sudden death (e.g., those with a history of syncope or resuscitated cardiac arrest), an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator is the therapy of choice.

## D (Braunwald, Ch 70: pp. 1350, 1359)  

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is defined as a natural death due to cardiac causes, in which abrupt loss of consciousness occurs within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. An estimated 390,000 out- of- hospital cases occur in the United States annually. There are two peak age distributions  

of sudden death: (1) from birth to 6 months of age (i.e., sudden infant death syndrome) and (2) between 45 and 75 years of age. Coronary artery disease is the structural basis for approximately \(80\%\) of SCDs.  

SCD is more common in men than woman, with a four- to seven- fold excess of SCD in men compared with women before age 65 years. At older ages, the difference decreases to 2:1 or less. A number of hereditary conditions can result in SCD, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and Brugada syndrome. This observation allows potential screening and preventive therapy for individuals at high risk.  

Hypertension and cigarette smoking, but not hypercholesterolemia, have been established as risk factors for SCD. In the Framingham study, intraventricular conduction abnormalities on the ECG (but not left ventricular hypertrophy or nonspecific ST- segment T wave abnormalities) were associated with an increased risk of SCD. Psychosocial factors such as social isolation and a high level of life stress were also found to increase the risk of sudden death.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 383  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 64: pp. 1225-1226)  

The ECG illustrated shows atrial tachycardia with block. In this condition, an atrial rate of 130 to 200 beats/minute, with a ventricular response less than or equal to the atrial rate, is present. Digitalis toxicity accounts for this rhythm in \(50\%\) to \(75\%\) of cases, and in such instances the atrial rate may show a gradual increase if digoxin is continued. Other signs of digitalis excess are often present, including frequent premature ventricular complexes.  

In nearly one- half of all patients with atrial tachycardia with block, the atrial rate is irregular and demonstrates a characteristic isoelectric interval between each P wave, in contrast to the morphology of atrial flutter waves. Most instances of this rhythm occur in patients with significant organic heart disease. Causes other than digitalis toxicity include ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and cor pulmonale. In patients taking digitalis, potassium depletion may precipitate the arrhythmia, and the oral administration of potassium and the withholding of digoxin often will allow reversal to sinus rhythm. Because atrial tachycardia with block is seen primarily in patients with serious underlying heart disease, its onset may lead to significant clinical deterioration.

Approximately \(50\%\) of deaths caused by coronary artery disease (CAD) are sudden and unexpected, and approximately \(80\%\) of all sudden cardiac deaths in Western countries are related to CAD. Such events may complicate either an acute coronary syndrome or previously stable coronary disease, and in the latter case often relate to myocardial scar from prior infarction.

dysfunction and the presence of premature ventricular complexes in convalescence after myocardial infarction (MI) are both powerful predictors of sudden cardiac death (SCD). However, the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation in the earliest stages of acute MI (within the first 48 hours) does not identify long- term risk and is not an indication for implantable cardioverter- defibrillator therapy.  

The arrhythmias that most commonly cause cardiac arrest, in decreasing order of frequency, are ventricular fibrillation, bradyarrhythmias/asystole or pulseless electrical activity, and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Survival after an out- of- hospital cardiac arrest is best for those patients in whom sustained VT was the initial recorded rhythm. Patients with bradycardic/asystolic cardiac arrest have the worst prognosis.  

There are racial differences in the incidence of SCD throughout adulthood: compared with Caucasians, African Americans display a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death (Fig. 3.25).

## C (Braunwald, Ch 66: p. 1276; eTable 66G.2)  

Non- vitamin K- dependent direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS) include the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban. Compared with warfarin, these agents produce predictable anticoagulation, are more convenient to administer, and do not require routine blood test monitoring of coagulation. They are at least as effective as warfarin and cause fewer serious bleeding complications, especially less intracranial hemorrhage.  

DOACs have short half- lives, so minor bleeding complications can usually be managed by simply withholding the drug. More extensive measures are necessary for serious hemorrhage, but, unlike for bleeding caused by warfarin, vitamin K administration is ineffective. Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment indicated for reversal of dabigatran in the case of life- threatening bleeding and/or when emergency surgery is necessary and would be the most appropriate choice for this patient. The RE- VERSE AD trial confirmed the effectiveness of idarucizumab for rapid and safe reversal of dabigatran in 503 patients with uncontrolled bleeding or who were about to undergo an urgent invasive procedure. Hemodialysis may also be used to remove active dabigatran from the circulation in patients with renal failure but is better suited for less severe bleeding because of its delayed effect compared with idarucizumab.   

Andexanet alfa is approved for use in the United States to rapidly reverse the anticoagulant effect of the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban. An alternative approach to reverse the anticoagulant effect of current DOACs is four- factor prothrombin complex concentrate.  

Oral activated charcoal may help prevent absorption of DOACs ingested within the prior 4 hours and can be useful in the case of drug overdose.

Implantable cardioverter- defibrillators (ICDs) are indicated to prevent sudden death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The strongest evidence for their use is for secondary prevention in patients with reduced left ventricular function and resuscitated cardiac arrest or unstable sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. There

<--- Page Split --->

is also strong evidence for ICDs being beneficial in primary prevention of sudden death, a therapy that changed the approach to chronic heart failure care in patients with systolic dysfunction and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).  

Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who have been shown to derive benefit from ICD therapy are those who are at least 40 days after acute myocardial infarction. In patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and LVEF of \(35\%\) or less, a trial of optimal heart failure therapy, with reassessment of the LVEF, is appropriate prior to ICD placement because systolic dysfunction may improve in the interim. Patients with identifiable reversible causes of cardiomyopathy (e.g., tachycardia- mediated, alcoholic) should not receive an ICD until reassessment of ventricular function after correction of those contributors.  

Patients with significant comorbid conditions that would limit survival with acceptable functional status (e.g., metastatic cancer and end- stage renal disease) to less than 1 year are generally not appropriate candidates for an ICD.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 387  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 69: pp. 1326-1327; Table 69.1; see also Answer to Question 352)  

Selection of the appropriate mode of cardiac pacing depends on many factors, including the underlying rhythm disturbance, the patient's exercise capacity, and the chronotropic response to exercise. Ventricular inhibited pacing (VVI) inhibits ventricular pacemaker output if a ventricular event is sensed, but it does not sense or pace the atrium. This mode protects against bradycardias but does not restore or maintain atrioventricular (AV) synchrony, so that AV dissociation is common. In addition, in chronotropically incompetent patients in whom the sinus heart rate does not increase with exercise, this mode does not provide rate responsiveness. These deficiencies may result in the "pacemaker syndrome" of reduced functional capacity, shortness of breath, dizziness, and fatigue, which can occur in up to \(20\%\) of patients with normally functioning VVI pacing.  

Single- chamber triggered pacing (AAT or VVT) generates an output pulse every time a native event is sensed. As a result, it accelerates the rate of battery depletion. This mode of pacing is not frequently used.  

Atrial inhibited pacing inhibits atrial pacemaker output if an atrial event is sensed. It does not sense or pace the ventricle. It is an appropriate mode for patients with sinus node dysfunction who have normal AV conduction but should not be used in individuals with AV nodal disease. Dual- chamber pacing and sensing with inhibition and tracking (DDD) is typically the preferred mode of pacing for patients with combined sinus and AV node dysfunction, because physiologic pacing reduces the frequency of the pacemaker syndrome and may reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, no randomized trial has demonstrated any effect of pacing mode choice (DDD vs. VVI) on mortality in patients with sinus node dysfunction.   

In patients with AF, standard DDD or DDDR is not desirable, because P- synchronous pacing is not possible, and sensing of the chaotic atrial rhythm could trigger an accelerated ventricular pacing response. To compensate for this deficiency, DDD and DDDR devices commonly have an automatic mode switching feature that, when AF develops, inhibits atrial- sensed ventricular pacing.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 388  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 69: pp. 1328-1329, 1331; Table 69.2)  

Pacemaker malfunction may be manifested by impaired pacemaker output or failure to capture or sense the appropriate cardiac chamber. On the ECG, failure to capture is identified when a pacing "spike" is present without evidence of subsequent myocardial depolarization (a P wave or QRS complex). This condition can result from an abnormally elevated electrical threshold, lead dislodgement or perforation, impending battery depletion, or circuit failure. Threshold alterations may be due to medications (e.g., class IC antiarrhythmic agents) or electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, including hyperkalemia, severe acidosis and alkalosis, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and myxedema. Failure to sense can result from lead dislodgement or inadequate initial lead placement, lead insulation or circuit failure, electromagnetic radiation, or battery depletion.  

Patients with pacemakers should be cautioned about electromagnetic interference that could result in malfunction. An example is industrial- strength welding equipment; close contact should be avoided. Patients with pacemakers should be warned not to lean on or linger near electronic antitheft devices (situated at the exits of many stores) because pacemaker malfunction has been reported in that setting; simply walking past or through such devices is not problematic. Cellular telephones rarely interfere with the function of cardiac pacemakers; when they are placed in the normal position over the ear, rather than over the device, they do not pose a significant risk. As a rule, they should not be carried in the breast pocket ipsilateral to the pacemaker.  

Left bundle branch block morphology is the expected electrocardiographic pattern during standard right ventricular pacing owing to the delay in depolarization of left ventricular myocardium. The presence of right bundle

branch block after right ventricular pacemaker implantation is suggestive of accidental lead placement or migration into the left ventricle.  

Pseudofusion is present on the surface ECG when a pacing spike does not alter the normal morphology of a superimposed intrinsic QRS complex (Fig. 3.26). This results when a pacing impulse is delivered at the appropriate escape interval into myocardium whose action potentials are in the absolute refractory period owing to slightly earlier intrinsic activation. Pseudofusion can be distinguished from a fusion beat, in which the QRS complex represents the combination of intrinsic ventricular activation and effective pacemaker depolarization, producing a morphology intermediate between intrinsic and paced beats.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 389  

### A (Braunwald, Ch 69: pp. 1328-1330; Table 69.2)  

The figure depicts a close- up view of a chest radiograph in a patient with a single- chamber pacemaker. The finding of note is a fracture at the point where the lead dives below the clavicle (arrow in Fig. 3.27). The patient presented with intermittent failure to capture and intermittent failure to output on the ventricular lead. Lead impedance was greatly elevated.  

The telemetric measurement of voltage and current thresholds, lead impedance, and electrograms is very helpful in differentiating the causes of pacemaker malfunction. When a pacemaker wire has fractured, both the voltage threshold and the lead impedance are high. In the case of an insulation break, the voltage threshold and the lead impedance are low. In the setting of a dislodged lead, the voltage threshold is high, but the lead impedance is normal. Exit block may occur as the result of an inflammatory reaction at the point of contact between the pacemaker lead and the myocardium. When this occurs, the measured voltage and current thresholds are high but lead impedance is normal.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 390  

### B (Braunwald, Ch 65: pp. 1264-1268; eFig. 65.3)  

The ECG in the figure depicts atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate and aberrant conduction in a patient with Wolff- Parkinson- White (WPW) syndrome and a right posterosepal accessory pathway. The latter localization is possible because of the negative initial deflections in leads II, III, aVF, and \(\mathrm{V}_1\) , with upright initial forces in leads I and aVL. Acute treatment of this dysrhythmia should include agents that prolong refractoriness in the accessory pathway, such as intravenous procainamide or ibutilide. In hemodynamically unstable patients, direct- current cardioversion is the treatment of choice. Intravenous verapamil prolongs conduction time in the atrioventricular node without affecting conduction through the accessory pathway. Thus, the administration of verapamil to a patient with WPW in AF may accelerate conduction through the bypass tract and precipitate ventricular fibrillation, such that it should not be used in this setting.  

Electrocardiographic evidence of WPW syndrome is present in approximately \(0.25\%\) of healthy individuals. Three basic features characterize the electrocardiographic abnormalities of the syndrome: the presence of a PR interval less than 120 milliseconds during sinus rhythm; a QRS duration greater than 120 milliseconds with a slurred, slowly rising onset of the QRS in some leads (the delta wave); and secondary ST- segment/T wave changes generally directed opposite to the major QRS vector. The axis of the delta waves on the surface ECG can be used to localize the position of the accessory pathway in the heart. Left free wall accessory pathways are the most common, followed by posterosepal, right free wall, and anteroseptal locations.  

The prevalence of WPW is higher in men and decreases with age. Most associated dysrhythmias are reciprocating (reentrant) tachycardia (80%), with \(15\%\) to \(30\%\) presenting

<--- Page Split --->

as AF and \(5\%\) as atrial flutter. Although most adults with WPW syndrome have normal hearts, a number of cardiac defects are occasionally associated with this syndrome, including Ebstein anomaly. In patients with Ebstein anomaly, multiple accessory pathways are often present and are located on the right side of the heart, with pre- excitation localized to the atrialized ventricle.  

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 391  

## C (Braunwald, Ch 69: pp. 1326, 1332; Fig. 69.18)  

This patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of \(30\%\) and left bundle branch block with a QRS complex duration of approximately 190 milliseconds. He is on appropriate medical therapy with apparently normal filling pressures by physical examination and has persistent class III symptoms. Accordingly, he meets the guideline- based criteria for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). In addition, based on the reduced ejection fraction and persistent symptoms, he qualifies for implantation of a cardioverter- defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. The results of the COMPANION trial suggest incremental mortality benefit from a device capable of combined cardiac resynchronization and defibrillation over cardiac resynchronization alone in this population. The PROSPECT study did not support the use of echocardiographic measures of dyssynchrony as selection criteria for CRT in patients with a QRS duration 120 or more milliseconds. Patients with systolic heart failure who are most likely to respond to CRT are those in sinus rhythm, with typical left bundle branch block, QRS duration 150 or more milliseconds, and New York Heart Association class II to IV symptoms despite optimal guideline- based medical therapy.

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 392  

## D (Braunwald, Ch 65: p. 1268)  

The electrophysiologic tracing depicts a recording of ventricular depolarization over an accessory pathway. The first QRS complex is preexcited, with a short PR interval and delta wave on the surface ECG. The His bundle activation is buried within the ventricular complex (see lead His bundle recording). During the second beat, the accessory pathway is refractory, and normal conduction over the atrioventricular (AV) node ensues, generating a normal QRS complex. In this normal complex, His bundle activation clearly precedes ventricular activation, with a measurable His- ventricular interval of 45 milliseconds. Ventricular pre- excitation in association with a delta wave is consistent with a diagnosis of Wolff- Parkinson- White (WPW) syndrome.  

Patients with ventricular preexcitation and symptomatic tachyarrhythmia require therapy. Options for management include pharmacologic therapy with class IA or IC antiarrhythmic drugs (which prolong the refractory period in the accessory pathway) and invasive treatment with radiofrequency catheter ablation. Both atenolol and verapamil prolong AV nodal conduction time but do not directly affect conduction through the accessory pathway. As a result, in patients with WPW syndrome and atrial fibrillation, these drugs may actually enhance ventricular response and precipitate ventricular fibrillation, and therefore they should be avoided. Radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with WPW syndrome has a high success rate and a low frequency of complications and is cost effective. It is the therapy of choice in this symptomatic young patient.

Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug, and its sole electrophysiologic effect appears to be blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current \(\mathrm{(I_{KR})}\) . Its effect is most pronounced in the atria, and the drug is approved for the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm, as well as chronic suppression of recurrent AF. A role in therapy for ventricular arrhythmias is not well established. Dofetilide has a neutral effect on mortality (i.e., it does not increase it) in patients after myocardial infarction.  

Dofetilide is well absorbed orally, with over \(90\%\) bioavailability. \(50\%\) to \(60\%\) of the drug is excreted in the urine, whereas the remainder undergoes hepatic metabolism to inert compounds. The drug's dosage must be adjusted based on the creatinine clearance (Ccr), and it should not be administered to patients with a Ccr of less than \(20 \mathrm{mL}/\) min. The most important adverse effect of dofetilide is QT interval prolongation with torsades de pointes, occurring in \(2\%\) to \(4\%\) of patients receiving the drug. The risk is highest in patients with hypokalemia, those taking other drugs that prolong repolarization, and when there is baseline QT interval prolongation. For this reason, dofetilide is approved only for inpatient initiation so that the QT interval can be closely monitored. Patients with a corrected baseline QT interval greater than 440 milliseconds (or \(>500\) milliseconds when there are ventricular conduction abnormalities) are not candidates for dofetilide therapy. Verapamil, ketoconazole, and trimethoprim all increase the serum dofetilide concentration and should not be used concurrently.

This 26- year- old man presents with atrial fibrillation (AF) after the New Year holiday, and most of his prior episodes of AF have occurred following weekends. These facts should

<--- Page Split --->

prompt consideration of the "holiday heart syndrome," which is the occurrence of palpitations, chest discomfort, and syncope after a binge of alcohol consumption.  

The most common arrhythmia associated with this syndrome is AF, followed by atrial flutter and frequent ventricular premature beats. Electrophysiologic testing in subjects without heart disease suggests that alcohol enhances the vulnerability of the heart to induction of atrial arrhythmias. AF in this situation usually occurs several hours after the last drink and may also be related to the onset of early withdrawal symptoms, especially sympathetic hyperactivity. Treatment is typically focused on abstinence from alcohol.  

Regular excess alcohol consumption is also an important cause of hypertension and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Ethanol abuse is a leading cause of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in industrialized nations. The likelihood of developing cardiomyopathy appears to correlate with the amount and duration of daily alcohol consumption, but there are wide variations in the susceptibility of individual patients to myocardial toxicity. With abstinence from alcohol, LV systolic and diastolic dysfunctions often improve.  

Cocaine is associated with multiple cardiovascular complications, most commonly myocardial ischemia and infarction due to coronary artery vasoconstriction and cocaine- enhanced platelet aggregation. Long- term cocaine use is also associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction, perhaps the sequelae of repeated, profound sympathetic stimulation. The direct arrhythmogenic potential of cocaine is not well established.
