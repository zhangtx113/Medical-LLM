## QUESTION 218  

A 76- year- old woman with permanent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease presents to the emergency department with anterior chest pressure of 2 hours' duration. Her medications include apixaban \(5\mathrm{mg}\) BID, metoprolol succinate \(100\mathrm{mg}\) daily, indapamide \(2.5\mathrm{mg}\) daily, and atorvastatin \(80\mathrm{mg}\) daily. Initial vital signs are heart rate 84 beats/minute, blood pressure \(149 / 86\mathrm{mm}\) Hg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation \(97\%\) . The ECG shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 84 beats/minute. There are \(2\mathrm{- mm}\) ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF, which are new compared with a tracing taken 6 months earlier. Serum cardiac troponin-T is elevated at \(1.3\mathrm{ng / mL}\) . At coronary angiography there is a \(95\%\) stenosis of the midright coronary artery, which is treated with a drug-eluting stent. In consideration of subsequent medications, which of the following statements about combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is correct?

## QUESTION 264  

A 63- year- old man with long- standing insulin- requiring diabetes presented to his physician's office 2 weeks ago for management of hypertension. His blood pressure was \(160 / 94\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{Hg}\) . The serum creatinine was \(1.6\mathrm{mg / dL}\) , and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was \(30\mathrm{mg / dL}\) , with otherwise normal serum chemistries. A potassium- sparing diuretic (triamterene plus hydrochlorothiazide) was prescribed. When he returns 2 weeks later, the serum potassium level is \(6.8\mathrm{mmol / L}\) , with no significant change in BUN or creatinine level. The most likely contributing mechanism is:  

A. Excessive consumption of bananas and tomatoes  
B. A recent urinary tract infection  
C. Primary hyperaldosteronism  
D. Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism  
E. Cushing syndrome

B. Compared with clopidogrel, prasugrel reduces the risk of stent thrombosis  
C. Compared with clopidogrel, bleeding complications associated with prasugrel are lower  
D. Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke  
E. The risk of bleeding with prasugrel is higher in patients greater than 75 years of age
