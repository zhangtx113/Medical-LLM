C. The location of ST-segment elevations during exercise testing predicts the anatomic site of clinically advanced coronary stenosis  
D. Digoxin therapy is not associated with false-positive findings on exercise electrocardiography if the baseline ST segments are normal  

## QUESTION 91  

A patient underwent echocardiography as part of the evaluation of exertional dyspnea. Fig. 1.22 displays an image from the continuous- wave Doppler interrogation across the mitral valve, obtained from the apical long- axis view. Which of the following statements is TRUE?  

A. The early diastolic peak velocity of 2.7 m/second is within the normal range  
B. There is an abnormally delayed decline of the transtriat velocity signal during diastole  
C. There is no evidence of mitral regurgitation  
D. With color Doppler imaging, the extent of mitral regurgitation can be overestimated if the regurgitant jet is directed eccentrically along the left atrial wall

## QUESTION 92  

Which of the following statements regarding commonly used quality improvement strategies is correct?  

A. Iterative PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycles are most successful when goals are subjective, allowing the quality improvement team to think creatively without being constrained by a discrete goal  
B. The Lean approach focuses on high-level concepts, avoiding getting bogged down in the details of a process  
C. The Lean approach focuses on reducing unnecessary variation in a process  
D. Six Sigma is an iterative process of Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control  

## QUESTION 93  

A 25- year- old man died suddenly while jogging, and a postmortem examination was performed. A histologic section of left ventricular myocardium is shown in Fig. 1.23. Which of the following statements is TRUE?  
A. The histologic findings are of normal myocardium subjected to chronic vigorous exercise  
B. This condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait  
C. This is a disease of plasma membrane protein synthesis  
D. The greatest risk to affected patients is the development of complete heart block  
E. One specific mutation has been identified that accurately predicts sudden cardiac death in the majority of patients with this disorder

## QUESTION 94  

A 28- year- old woman presents for evaluation after a syncopal episode. Her family history is notable for sudden death in an older sibling. Physical examination reveals woolly hair and palmar keratosis. Electrocardiography demonstrates T wave inversions in leads \(\mathrm{V_1}\) to \(\mathrm{V_3}\) . An ambulatory (Holter) electrocardiographic monitor captures runs of ventricular tachycardia with a left bundle morphology and superior axis. A signal- averaged ECG demonstrates late potentials. Echocardiography demonstrates a mildly dilated right ventricle with reduced systolic function; the left ventricle appears structurally normal. Which of the following statements is TRUE about this condition?  

A. The majority of patients with this disorder have an abnormality of the ryanodine receptor. 
B. Endomyocardial biopsy establishes the diagnosis with high sensitivity 
C. This patient likely has a mutation in the plakoglobin gene 
D. This condition is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion 
E. Noncaseating granulomas are likely present in the right ventricular myocardium  

## QUESTION 95  

A 72- year- old man with multiple myeloma presents with progressive exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and peripheral edema. On examination the blood pressure is \(118 / 62\mathrm{mm}\) Hg without pulsus paradoxus; there is a \(25\mathrm{- mm}\) Hg systolic pressure postural decline. The jugular venous pressure is \(12\mathrm{cmH}_2\mathrm{O}\) , and there is periorbital purpura, macroglossia, hepatomegaly, and prominent symmetric pitting edema to the level of the midthighs. His ECG is remarkable for very low limb lead voltage. Which of the following echocardiographic findings is expected?  

A. Increased right ventricular wall thickness with normal left ventricular thickness 
B. Abnormal regional longitudinal strain on speckle tracking that spares the apex 
C. Reversal of normal tissue Doppler mitral annular E' velocity ratio (medial \(>\) lateral) 
D. Very large pericardial effusion
