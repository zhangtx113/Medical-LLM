## Example
Input Text:
"Cardiac muscle cells contain myofibrils for contraction, mitochondria that generate ATP, and a sarcoplasmic reticulum regulating calcium cycling."

Input Question:
"What are the main structures and functions of cardiac muscle cells?" (Definition)

Expected Output:
{
  "think": "Cardiac muscle cells contain myofibrils responsible for contraction, mitochondria that generate ATP, and a sarcoplasmic reticulum that regulates calcium cycling. Together, these structures sustain rhythmic contraction and relaxation.",
  "answer": "Cardiac muscle cells contain myofibrils, mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic reticulum that regulate contraction and relaxation.",
  "keyword": "myofibrils, mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum, contraction, relaxation"
}

## Output Format:
{
  "think": "...",
  "answer": "...",
  "keyword": "..."
