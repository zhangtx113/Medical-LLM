Phospholamban normally suppresses SERCA2 activity, which governs calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during diastole. Enhanced SERCA2 activity accelerates calcium removal, improving diastolic relaxation. However, in thyroid disease, excessive thyroid hormone overactivates this pathway, leading to impaired calcium handling and reduced diastolic function. Transgenic animals lacking phospholamban show no increased contractility under hyperthyroidism, confirming the pathway's role.

{"question": "What is the method used in psychological stress tests to induce myocardial ischemia, and how does it compare to exercise stress tests?", "think": "Psychological stress tests induce myocardial ischemia through mental tasks like mental arithmetic, color naming, and public speaking. These tests differ from exercise stress tests in three key ways: (1) they occur at lower oxygen consumption levels, (2) they involve increased systemic vascular resistance (leading to higher afterload) rather than decreased resistance during exercise, and (3) ischemia is not directly correlated with coronary artery disease severity, unlike exercise-induced ischemia. The hemodynamic response (heart rate-blood pressure product) during psychological stress is lower than during exercise, despite potential coronary vasoconstriction and microvascular dysfunction.", "answer": "Psychological stress tests use mental tasks (e.g., arithmetic, public speaking) to induce ischemia.
