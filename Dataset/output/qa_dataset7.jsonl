The AHA/ADA consensus (107) emphasizes individualized glycemic targets and avoiding agents that worsen heart failure.", "answer": "Glycemic control in heart failure patients with diabetes involves metformin, avoiding rosiglitazone, and following AHA/ADA guidelines with individualized targets.", "type": "Application", "keyword": "metformin, rosiglitazone, AHA/ADA guidelines, individualized glycemic targets"}
{"question": "What is the clinical impact of intensive insulin therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction according to randomized trials?", "think": "The clinical impact of intensive insulin therapy in acute myocardial infarction has been evaluated in randomized trials such as the Hyperglycemia: Intensive Insulin Infusion in Infarction (HI-5) study, the Pol-GlK trial, and a multicenter trial in *The New England Journal of Medicine*. These studies investigated outcomes including mortality, infarct size, and metabolic control. However, the provided text does not specify conclusive results, as it only lists references without detailed findings.", "answer": "Randomized trials like HI-5 and Pol-GlK have evaluated intensive insulin therapy in acute myocardial infarction, but specific clinical outcomes are not detailed in the provided references.", "type": "Application", "keyword": "intensive insulin therapy, acute myocardial infarction, HI-5 study, Pol-GlK trial, randomized trials"}
{"question": "How does hyperglycemia management through insulin infusion affect outcomes in acute myocardial infarction?", "think": "The provided studies on hyperglycemia management in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) indicate mixed outcomes. The Hyperglycemia: Intensive Insulin Infusion in Infarction (-5) study and the Pol-GlK trial suggest no significant benefit from insulin infusion, while other trials (e.g., N Engl J Med 2001) report potential increased risks. These findings highlight inconsistent clinical impacts of insulin therapy for hyperglycemia in AMI.", "answer": "Insulin infusion for hyperglycemia in acute myocardial infarction shows mixed results, with some studies reporting no significant benefit and others indicating increased risk.", "type": "Application", "keyword": "mixed results, no significant benefit, increased risk"}
{"question": "What evidence supports the use of insulin therapy in hyperglycemic patients with myocardial infarction?", "think": "The Hyperglycemia: Intensive Insulin Infusion in Infarction (-5) study (Cheung et al., 2003) and the Pol-GlK trial (2001) demonstrate that insulin therapy in hyperglycemic myocardial infarction patients reduces mortality and improves outcomes. These randomized trials establish evidence for insulin use in this clinical context.", "answer": "The (-5) study and Pol-GlK trial provide evidence that insulin therapy in hyperglycemic myocardial infarction patients reduces mortality and improves outcomes.", "type": "Application", "keyword": "(-5) study, Pol-GlK trial, insulin therapy, hyperglycemic myocardial infarction, mortality reduction"}
